Specifically, the MOE exceeded 10% for all Black and Hispanic/Latino population estimates across the selected tracts, while White population estimates were somewhat more reliable, though still flagged in over half of the tracts.\n\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:**\n1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?\n2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\n3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?\n4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\n*Overall Pattern Identification*\nThe multi-level analysis — spanning county-level median income estimates and tract-level demographic breakdowns — reveals systematic data reliability challenges in ACS 5-year estimates\nCounty-level: At county scale, median household income estimates show notable variability. Using a 10% MOE cutoff, most counties fell into moderate or low confidence categories, highlighting that uncertainty exists even at higher aggregation levels\nTract-level: Reliability issues intensify at the tract scale. Every tract exceeded the 10% MOE threshold for at least one demographic subgroup, 100% of tracts were flagged as high-MOE:(\n\n*Equity Assessment*\nThe communities at greatest risk of algorithmic bias are:\nSmaller or rural tracts: Populations with fewer respondents also face higher sampling error, compounding reliability problems.\nBlack and Hispanic/Latino communities: Their tract-level ACS estimates never meet the 10% reliability threshold. If an allocation algorithm treats these noisy estimates as precise, it will undervalue their needs and direct resources elsewhere.\n\n*Root Cause Analysis*\nThe patterns are rooted in structural features of ACS data collection:\nSampling limits: Smaller population groups produce larger standard errors.\nDifferential nonresponse: Minority and immigrant communities may less likely to respond due to barriers and distrust.\nSurvey design constraints: The ACS 5-year estimates aggregate limited samples, and subgroup breakdowns at tract scale exceed the data’s design precision.\n\n*Strategic Recommendations*\nData use：\nFlag any tract with MOE% > 10 and avoid treating estimates as precise since sample size is small in tract level.\nUse fallback geography (county) for variables with extreme MOE.\n\nStrengthen inputs：\nBlend multiple indicators (poverty, rent burden, child poverty) to reduce reliance on a single noisy variable.\nImprove ACS participation via targeted outreach and language support in undercounted communities.\n\nOutside the data:\nIntroduce human review for flagged tracts before final funding decisions.\nPilot and monitor the algorithm annually, recalibrating thresholds as survey data quality evolves.\nDocument and communicate uncertainty explicitly to policymakers and stakeholders.\n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n```{r recommendations-data}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n\n# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():\n# - High Confidence: \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\"\n# - Moderate Confidence: \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\"  \n# - Low Confidence: \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\n\nsum_table <- county_data_clean %>%\n  select(NAME, median_incomeE, MOE, reliability) %>%\n  mutate(\n    recommendation = case_when(\n      reliability == \"High Confidence\" ~ \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\",\n      reliability == \"Moderate Confidence\" ~ \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\",\n      reliability == \"Low Confidence\" ~ \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\n    )\n  )\n\n# Format as a professional table with kable()\n\nkable(\n  sum_table,\n  digits = 1,\n  caption = \"Decision Framework for Algorithmic Implementation\"\n)\n\n```\n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n\n**Your Task:** Use your analysis results to provide specific guidance to the department.\n\n1. **Counties suitable for immediate algorithmic implementation:** \nAitkin, Anoka, Becker, Blue Earth, Brown, Carver, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Crow Wing, Dakota, Dodge, Fillmore, Freeborn, Goodhue, Hennepin, Hubbard, Isanti, Itasca, Kanabec, Kandiyohi, Lake, Le Sueur, Lyon, Marshall, Meeker, Mille Lacs, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Pine, Pope, Ramsey, Renville, Rice, Roseau, St. Louis, Scott, Sherburne, Sibley, Stearns, Steele, Wabasha, Wadena, Washington, Wright\n\nCounties listed above have suitable sample size and stronger ACS samples, which means lower MOE.\nDemographic estimates are robust enough to support algorithm-driven funding without significant reliability concerns.\nAlgorithms here can be implemented immediately with standard fairness monitoring.\n\n2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** \nBeltrami, Benton, Big Stone, Carlton, Chippewa, Clearwater, Cook, Cottonwood, Douglas, Faribault, Grant, Houston, Jackson, Kittson, Koochiching, Lac qui Parle, Lincoln, McLeod, Mahnomen, Martin, Mower, Murray, Nicollet, Nobles, Norman, Pennington, Pipestone, Polk, Red Lake, Redwood, Rock, Swift, Todd, Waseca, Watonwan, Wilkin, Winona, Yellow Medicine.\n\nRecommended monitoring actions for counties above:\nOutcome audits: Compare algorithmic allocations against program participation data.\nSensitivity testing: Run models with upper/lower confidence bounds (estimate ± MOE) to test robustness.\nFlagging system: Automatically flag tracts/counties with borderline estimates for human review.\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:**ss\nTraverse\n\nSuggested alternatives:\nManual review: Use staff expertise and local knowledge to adjust allocations.\nSupplemental data: Incorporate administrative records (school eligibility, Medicaid enrollment, unemployment claims) to cross-validate needs.\nCommunity engagement: Consult local service providers or conduct targeted surveys to supplement missing precision.\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\nBeyond race/ethnicity, do other vulnerable groups (e.g., low-income households, elderly residents, non-English speakers) also experience systematically higher MOE?\nCould combining ACS with administrative datasets (SNAP, TANF, Medicaid) reduce disparities in data reliability?\nHow stable are tract-level estimates over time, and do reliability issues persist across survey cycles?\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on [2025/09/27]\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version [4.5.1]\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: [portfolio-setup-jyxu48/Assignments/assignment_1/]\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\nCounty Selection: Minnesota was chosen as the state of analysis, with Hennepin County initially used as a representative large metropolitan area. The analysis was later expanded to include all counties statewide to examine systematic patterns.\n\nVariable Choice: We relied on ACS 5-year (2022) estimates for median household income, total population, and racial/ethnic composition (White alone, Black/African American alone, and Hispanic/Latino). Results therefore depend on ACS methodology and survey design.\n\nReliability Thresholds: Data quality was assessed by calculating MOE percentages (MOE ÷ estimate × 100). For this project, a 10% cutoff was applied to flag “high MOE,” with <5% labeled as High Confidence, 5–10% as Moderate Confidence, and >10% as Low Confidence. The 10% setting is more stringent than some standard practices (e.g., 15%), which increases sensitivity to data reliability concerns.\n\n**Limitations:**\nACS tract-level estimates have sampling errors, especially for small subgroups.\nFindings sensitive to thresholds, year, and variable selection.\nResults reflect ACS survey design, not absolute ground truth.\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [·] All code chunks run without errors\n- [·] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [·] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [·] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [·] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [·] Census API key is properly set \n- [·] Document renders correctly to HTMLs\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.

Small sample size or hidden factors account for high MOEs.]\n\n# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis\n\n## 3.1 Focus Area Selection\n\n**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for detailed tract-level study.\n\n**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability levels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to compare how data quality varies.\n\n```{r select-counties}\n# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data\n# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties\n\nhigh_conf <- county_data_clean %>%\n  filter(reliability == \"High Confidence\") %>%\n  slice(2)\n\nmoderate_conf <- county_data_clean %>%\n  filter(reliability == \"Moderate Confidence\") %>%\n  slice(9)\n\nlow_conf <- county_data_clean %>%\n  filter(reliability == \"Low Confidence\") %>%\n  slice(1)\n\nselected_counties_allv <- bind_rows(high_conf, moderate_conf, low_conf)\n\n# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics\n# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\nselected_counties <- selected_counties_allv %>%\n  select(NAME, median_incomeE, MOE, reliability, total_populationE)\nselected_counties\n```\n\n**Comment on the output:** [The output is clear, but I don't know if it's good to ignore the GEOID :-]\n\n## 3.2 Tract-Level Demographics\n\n**Your Task:** Get demographic data for census tracts in your selected counties.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: tract level\n- Variables: white alone (B03002_003), Black/African American (B03002_004), Hispanic/Latino (B03002_012), total population (B03002_001)\n- Use the same state and year as before\n- Output format: wide\n- **Challenge:** You'll need county codes, not names. Look at the GEOID patterns in your county data for hints.\n\n```{r tract-demographics}\n# Define your race/ethnicity variables with descriptive names\n\nrace <- c(\n  white = \"B03002_003\",\n  black = \"B03002_004\",\n  hispanic = \"B03002_012\",\n  total_pop = \"B03002_001\"\n)\n\n# Use get_acs() to retrieve tract-level data\n# Hint: You may need to specify county codes in the county parameter\n\nselected_county_codes <- selected_counties_allv %>%\n  mutate(county_code = str_sub(GEOID, 3, 5)) %>%  \n  pull(county_code)\n\ntract_data <- get_acs(\n  geography = \"tract\",\n  state = \"27\",\n  county = selected_county_codes,\n  variables = race,\n  year = 2022,\n  survey = \"acs5\",\n  output = \"wide\"\n)\n\ntract_data\n\n# Calculate percentage of each group using mutate()\n# Create percentages for white, Black, and Hispanic populations\ntract_data2 <- tract_data %>%\n  mutate(pct_white = (whiteE / total_popE) * 100) %>%\n  mutate(pct_black = (blackE / total_popE) * 100) %>%\n  mutate(pct_hispanic = (hispanicE / total_popE) * 100)\n\ntract_data2 \n\n# Add readable tract and county name columns using str_extract() or similar\n\ntract_data3 <- tract_data2 %>%\n  mutate(\n    tract_id = str_extract(NAME, \"Census Tract \\\\d+\"),     \n    tract_id = str_remove(tract_id, \"Census Tract \"),\n    \n    county_name = str_extract(NAME, \"(?<=;

Specifically, the MOE exceeded 10% for all Black and Hispanic/Latino population estimates across the selected tracts, while White population estimates were somewhat more reliable, though still flagged in over half of the tracts.\n\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:**\n1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?\n2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\n3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?\n4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\n*Overall Pattern Identification*\nThe multi-level analysis — spanning county-level median income estimates and tract-level demographic breakdowns — reveals systematic data reliability challenges in ACS 5-year estimates\nCounty-level: At county scale, median household income estimates show notable variability. Using a 10% MOE cutoff, most counties fell into moderate or low confidence categories, highlighting that uncertainty exists even at higher aggregation levels\nTract-level: Reliability issues intensify at the tract scale. Every tract exceeded the 10% MOE threshold for at least one demographic subgroup, 100% of tracts were flagged as high-MOE:(\n\n*Equity Assessment*\nThe communities at greatest risk of algorithmic bias are:\nSmaller or rural tracts: Populations with fewer respondents also face higher sampling error, compounding reliability problems.\nBlack and Hispanic/Latino communities: Their tract-level ACS estimates never meet the 10% reliability threshold. If an allocation algorithm treats these noisy estimates as precise, it will undervalue their needs and direct resources elsewhere.\n\n*Root Cause Analysis*\nThe patterns are rooted in structural features of ACS data collection:\nSampling limits: Smaller population groups produce larger standard errors.\nDifferential nonresponse: Minority and immigrant communities may less likely to respond due to barriers and distrust.\nSurvey design constraints: The ACS 5-year estimates aggregate limited samples, and subgroup breakdowns at tract scale exceed the data’s design precision.\n\n*Strategic Recommendations*\nData use：\nFlag any tract with MOE% > 10 and avoid treating estimates as precise since sample size is small in tract level.\nUse fallback geography (county) for variables with extreme MOE.\n\nStrengthen inputs：\nBlend multiple indicators (poverty, rent burden, child poverty) to reduce reliance on a single noisy variable.\nImprove ACS participation via targeted outreach and language support in undercounted communities.\n\nOutside the data:\nIntroduce human review for flagged tracts before final funding decisions.\nPilot and monitor the algorithm annually, recalibrating thresholds as survey data quality evolves.\nDocument and communicate uncertainty explicitly to policymakers and stakeholders.\n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your Task:** Create a decision framework for algorithm implementation.\n\n```{r recommendations-data}\n# Create a summary table using your county reliability data\n# Include: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\n\n# Add a new column with algorithm recommendations using case_when():\n# - High Confidence: \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\"\n# - Moderate Confidence: \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\"  \n# - Low Confidence: \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\n\nsum_table <- county_data_clean %>%\n  select(NAME, median_incomeE, MOE, reliability) %>%\n  mutate(\n    recommendation = case_when(\n      reliability == \"High Confidence\" ~ \"Safe for algorithmic decisions\",\n      reliability == \"Moderate Confidence\" ~ \"Use with caution - monitor outcomes\",\n      reliability == \"Low Confidence\" ~ \"Requires manual review or additional data\"\n    )\n  )\n\n# Format as a professional table with kable()\n\nkable(\n  sum_table,\n  digits = 1,\n  caption = \"Decision Framework for Algorithmic Implementation\"\n)\n\n```\n\n**Key Recommendations:**\n\n**Your Task:** Use your analysis results to provide specific guidance to the department.\n\n1. **Counties suitable for immediate algorithmic implementation:** \nAitkin, Anoka, Becker, Blue Earth, Brown, Carver, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Crow Wing, Dakota, Dodge, Fillmore, Freeborn, Goodhue, Hennepin, Hubbard, Isanti, Itasca, Kanabec, Kandiyohi, Lake, Le Sueur, Lyon, Marshall, Meeker, Mille Lacs, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Pine, Pope, Ramsey, Renville, Rice, Roseau, St. Louis, Scott, Sherburne, Sibley, Stearns, Steele, Wabasha, Wadena, Washington, Wright\n\nCounties listed above have suitable sample size and stronger ACS samples, which means lower MOE.\nDemographic estimates are robust enough to support algorithm-driven funding without significant reliability concerns.\nAlgorithms here can be implemented immediately with standard fairness monitoring.\n\n2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** \nBeltrami, Benton, Big Stone, Carlton, Chippewa, Clearwater, Cook, Cottonwood, Douglas, Faribault, Grant, Houston, Jackson, Kittson, Koochiching, Lac qui Parle, Lincoln, McLeod, Mahnomen, Martin, Mower, Murray, Nicollet, Nobles, Norman, Pennington, Pipestone, Polk, Red Lake, Redwood, Rock, Swift, Todd, Waseca, Watonwan, Wilkin, Winona, Yellow Medicine.\n\nRecommended monitoring actions for counties above:\nOutcome audits: Compare algorithmic allocations against program participation data.\nSensitivity testing: Run models with upper/lower confidence bounds (estimate ± MOE) to test robustness.\nFlagging system: Automatically flag tracts/counties with borderline estimates for human review.\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:**ss\nTraverse\n\nSuggested alternatives:\nManual review: Use staff expertise and local knowledge to adjust allocations.\nSupplemental data: Incorporate administrative records (school eligibility, Medicaid enrollment, unemployment claims) to cross-validate needs.\nCommunity engagement: Consult local service providers or conduct targeted surveys to supplement missing precision.\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\nBeyond race/ethnicity, do other vulnerable groups (e.g., low-income households, elderly residents, non-English speakers) also experience systematically higher MOE?\nCould combining ACS with administrative datasets (SNAP, TANF, Medicaid) reduce disparities in data reliability?\nHow stable are tract-level estimates over time, and do reliability issues persist across survey cycles?\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on [2025/09/27]\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version [4.5.1]\n- Census API key required for replication\n- Complete code and documentation available at: [portfolio-setup-jyxu48/Assignments/assignment_1/]\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\nCounty Selection: Minnesota was chosen as the state of analysis, with Hennepin County initially used as a representative large metropolitan area. The analysis was later expanded to include all counties statewide to examine systematic patterns.\n\nVariable Choice: We relied on ACS 5-year (2022) estimates for median household income, total population, and racial/ethnic composition (White alone, Black/African American alone, and Hispanic/Latino). Results therefore depend on ACS methodology and survey design.\n\nReliability Thresholds: Data quality was assessed by calculating MOE percentages (MOE ÷ estimate × 100). For this project, a 10% cutoff was applied to flag “high MOE,” with <5% labeled as High Confidence, 5–10% as Moderate Confidence, and >10% as Low Confidence. The 10% setting is more stringent than some standard practices (e.g., 15%), which increases sensitivity to data reliability concerns.\n\n**Limitations:**\nACS tract-level estimates have sampling errors, especially for small subgroups.\nFindings sensitive to thresholds, year, and variable selection.\nResults reflect ACS survey design, not absolute ground truth.\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [·] All code chunks run without errors\n- [·] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [·] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [·] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [·] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [·] Census API key is properly set \n- [·] Document renders correctly to HTMLs\n\n**Remember:** Submit your portfolio URL on Canvas, not the file itself.
