Low median household income (choose an appropriate threshold)\n2. Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate threshold)\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\n\n# bottom 25%\nlow_income_threshold <- quantile(pa_demographics$median_income, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)  \n# top 25%\nhigh_elderly_threshold <- quantile(pa_demographics$pct_65plus, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)   \n\n\npa_vulnerable <- pa_demographics %>%\n  mutate(\n    vulnerable_income = median_income < low_income_threshold,\n    vulnerable_age = pct_65plus > high_elderly_threshold,\n    vulnerable = vulnerable_income & vulnerable_age\n  )\n\nvulnerable_count <- sum(pa_vulnerable$vulnerable, na.rm = TRUE)\ntotal_tracts <- nrow(pa_vulnerable)\nvulnerable_pct <- 100 * vulnerable_count / total_tracts\n\nvulnerable_count\nvulnerable_pct\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What income threshold did you choose and why?\n\nI chose the bottom 25% of tracts based on median household income, which corresponds to tracts with income below approximately $54,000. This threshold identifies communities that are relatively low-income compared to the rest of Pennsylvania.\n\n- What elderly population threshold did you choose and why?\n\nElderly population threshold: I selected the top 25% of tracts by percentage of residents aged 65 and over, representing tracts where more than about 20.5% of residents are elderly. This captures areas with a significantly aging population that may face accessibility and healthcare challenges.\n\n- How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?\n\n165\n\n- What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition?\n\n4.78816%\n\n---\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals \n\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Transform to appropriate projected CRS\npa_vul <- pa_vulnerable %>%\n  filter(vulnerable)\npa_vul_proj <- st_transform(pa_vul, 26917)\npa_hos_proj <- st_transform(pa_hos, 26917)\n\n# Calculate distance from each tract centroid to nearest hospital\n\nvul_center <- pa_vul_proj %>%\n  st_centroid()\n\nvul_center <- vul_center %>%\n  mutate(\n    nearest_idx = st_nearest_feature(., pa_hos_proj)  \n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    dist_mi = st_distance(., pa_hos_proj[nearest_idx, ], by_element = TRUE) %>%\n      set_units(\"mi\") %>%\n      drop_units() \n  )\n\nsummary_stats <- vul_center %>%\n  summarize(\n    avg_dist_mi = mean(dist_mi, na.rm = TRUE),\n    max_dist_mi = max(dist_mi, na.rm = TRUE),\n    over15_count = sum(dist_mi > 15, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_vul = n()\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    pct_over15 = 100 * over15_count / total_vul\n  )\n\nsummary_stats %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  kable(\n    caption = \"Table. Hospital Access Among Vulnerable Census Tracts in Pennsylvania\",\n    digits = 2,\n    align = \"lrrrr\"\n  )\n\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Use an appropriate projected coordinate system for Pennsylvania\n- Calculate distances in miles\n- Explain why you chose your projection\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts?\n\n4.75miles\n\n- What is the maximum distance?\n\n19.16miles\n\n- How many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital?\n\n9\n\n---\n\n#### Step 5: Identify Underserved Areas \n\nDefine \"underserved\" as vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Create underserved variable\n\nvul_center <- vul_center %>%\n  mutate(\n    underserved= (as.numeric(dist_mi> 15))\n  )\n\nunder_count= sum(vul_center$underserved)  \nvul_pct= under_count/ nrow(vul_center)\nunder_count\nvul_pct\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- How many tracts are underserved?\n\n9\n\n- What percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved?\n\n5.45%\n\n- Does this surprise you? Why or why not?\n\nYes — I didn’t expect any tracts to be this far from a hospital. This suggests that while most of Pennsylvania’s vulnerable areas have reasonable healthcare access, a few rural or remote tracts still face significant geographic barriers to medical services.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 6: Aggregate to County Level\n\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\npa_county <- st_transform(pa_county, crs=26917)\nvul_center<- st_transform(vul_center, crs=st_crs(pa_county))\n\nst_county <- st_join(\n  pa_county,\n  vul_center,\n  join  = st_contains,\n  left  = TRUE                # keep all counties\n)\n\n# Aggregate statistics by county\n\nagg_county <- st_county %>%\n  group_by(COUNTY_NAM) %>%\n  summarise(\n    vul_count= sum(vulnerable),\n    und_count= sum(underserved),\n    pct_vul_underserved = 100 * sum(vulnerable & underserved) / sum(vulnerable),\n    avg_dist_vulnerable = mean(dist_mi[vulnerable], na.rm = TRUE),\n    vul_pop = sum(total_pop[vulnerable]),\n    und_pop = sum(total_pop[underserved])\n  )\n\nagg_county <- agg_county %>%\n  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~replace(., is.na(.), 0)))\nagg_county\n```\n\n```{r}\n# --- Step 6: Top 5 counties with highest % of underserved vulnerable tracts ---\ntop5_underserved <- agg_county %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  arrange(desc(pct_vul_underserved)) %>%\n  select(COUNTY_NAM, pct_vul_underserved, vul_count, und_count) %>%\n  head(5)\n\n# --- Step 7: Top 5 counties with largest vulnerable population far from hospitals ---\ntop5_vulpop_far <- agg_county %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  arrange(desc(und_pop)) %>%\n  select(COUNTY_NAM, und_pop, vul_pop, avg_dist_vulnerable) %>%\n  head(5)\n\n# --- Step 8: Display results ---\ntop5_underserved\ntop5_vulpop_far\n```\n+\n\n**Required county-level statistics:**\n- Number of vulnerable tracts\n- Number of underserved tracts  \n- Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved\n- Average distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts\n- Total vulnerable population\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- Which 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts?\n\nBRADFORD\nFOREST\nJUNIATA\nMONROE\nSULLIVAN\n\n- Which counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals?\n\nBRADFORD\nCLEARFIELD\nDAUPHIN\nPOTTER\nCRAWFORD\n\n- Are there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?\n\nThese are typically larger rural counties where population is dispersed and hospitals are sparse.\nUrban counties (like Philadelphia or Allegheny) rarely appear because of dense hospital networks.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 7: Create Summary Table \n\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for healthcare investment.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Create and format priority counties table\nagg_county <- agg_county %>%\n  mutate(\n    z_vul_pop     = scales::rescale(vul_pop),       # vulnerability\n    z_underserved = scales::rescale(pct_vul_underserved), # service deficit\n    z_distance    = scales::rescale(avg_dist_vulnerable), # accessibility\n    priority_score = 0.25*z_vul_pop + 0.1*z_underserved + 0.65*z_distance\n  )\n\npriority_table <- agg_county %>%\n  arrange(desc(priority_score)) %>%\n  slice(1:10) %>%\n  transmute(\n    `County` = COUNTY_NAM,\n    `Priority Score` = round(priority_score*100, 2),\n    `Vulnerable Population` = comma(vul_pop),\n    `Avg.

Low median household income (choose an appropriate threshold)\n2. Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate threshold)\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\n\n# bottom 25%\nlow_income_threshold <- quantile(pa_demographics$median_income, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)  \n# top 25%\nhigh_elderly_threshold <- quantile(pa_demographics$pct_65plus, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)   \n\n\npa_vulnerable <- pa_demographics %>%\n  mutate(\n    vulnerable_income = median_income < low_income_threshold,\n    vulnerable_age = pct_65plus > high_elderly_threshold,\n    vulnerable = vulnerable_income & vulnerable_age\n  )\n\nvulnerable_count <- sum(pa_vulnerable$vulnerable, na.rm = TRUE)\ntotal_tracts <- nrow(pa_vulnerable)\nvulnerable_pct <- 100 * vulnerable_count / total_tracts\n\nvulnerable_count\nvulnerable_pct\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What income threshold did you choose and why?\n\nI chose the bottom 25% of tracts based on median household income, which corresponds to tracts with income below approximately $54,000. This threshold identifies communities that are relatively low-income compared to the rest of Pennsylvania.\n\n- What elderly population threshold did you choose and why?\n\nElderly population threshold: I selected the top 25% of tracts by percentage of residents aged 65 and over, representing tracts where more than about 20.5% of residents are elderly. This captures areas with a significantly aging population that may face accessibility and healthcare challenges.\n\n- How many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?\n\n165\n\n- What percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition?\n\n4.78816%\n\n---\n\n#### Step 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals \n\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Transform to appropriate projected CRS\npa_vul <- pa_vulnerable %>%\n  filter(vulnerable)\npa_vul_proj <- st_transform(pa_vul, 26917)\npa_hos_proj <- st_transform(pa_hos, 26917)\n\n# Calculate distance from each tract centroid to nearest hospital\n\nvul_center <- pa_vul_proj %>%\n  st_centroid()\n\nvul_center <- vul_center %>%\n  mutate(\n    nearest_idx = st_nearest_feature(., pa_hos_proj)  \n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    dist_mi = st_distance(., pa_hos_proj[nearest_idx, ], by_element = TRUE) %>%\n      set_units(\"mi\") %>%\n      drop_units() \n  )\n\nsummary_stats <- vul_center %>%\n  summarize(\n    avg_dist_mi = mean(dist_mi, na.rm = TRUE),\n    max_dist_mi = max(dist_mi, na.rm = TRUE),\n    over15_count = sum(dist_mi > 15, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_vul = n()\n  ) %>%\n  mutate(\n    pct_over15 = 100 * over15_count / total_vul\n  )\n\nsummary_stats %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  kable(\n    caption = \"Table. Hospital Access Among Vulnerable Census Tracts in Pennsylvania\",\n    digits = 2,\n    align = \"lrrrr\"\n  )\n\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Use an appropriate projected coordinate system for Pennsylvania\n- Calculate distances in miles\n- Explain why you chose your projection\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts?\n\n4.75miles\n\n- What is the maximum distance?\n\n19.16miles\n\n- How many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital?\n\n9\n\n---\n\n#### Step 5: Identify Underserved Areas \n\nDefine \"underserved\" as vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Create underserved variable\n\nvul_center <- vul_center %>%\n  mutate(\n    underserved= (as.numeric(dist_mi> 15))\n  )\n\nunder_count= sum(vul_center$underserved)  \nvul_pct= under_count/ nrow(vul_center)\nunder_count\nvul_pct\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- How many tracts are underserved?\n\n9\n\n- What percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved?\n\n5.45%\n\n- Does this surprise you? Why or why not?\n\nYes — I didn’t expect any tracts to be this far from a hospital. This suggests that while most of Pennsylvania’s vulnerable areas have reasonable healthcare access, a few rural or remote tracts still face significant geographic barriers to medical services.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 6: Aggregate to County Level\n\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\npa_county <- st_transform(pa_county, crs=26917)\nvul_center<- st_transform(vul_center, crs=st_crs(pa_county))\n\nst_county <- st_join(\n  pa_county,\n  vul_center,\n  join  = st_contains,\n  left  = TRUE                # keep all counties\n)\n\n# Aggregate statistics by county\n\nagg_county <- st_county %>%\n  group_by(COUNTY_NAM) %>%\n  summarise(\n    vul_count= sum(vulnerable),\n    und_count= sum(underserved),\n    pct_vul_underserved = 100 * sum(vulnerable & underserved) / sum(vulnerable),\n    avg_dist_vulnerable = mean(dist_mi[vulnerable], na.rm = TRUE),\n    vul_pop = sum(total_pop[vulnerable]),\n    und_pop = sum(total_pop[underserved])\n  )\n\nagg_county <- agg_county %>%\n  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~replace(., is.na(.), 0)))\nagg_county\n```\n\n```{r}\n# --- Step 6: Top 5 counties with highest % of underserved vulnerable tracts ---\ntop5_underserved <- agg_county %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  arrange(desc(pct_vul_underserved)) %>%\n  select(COUNTY_NAM, pct_vul_underserved, vul_count, und_count) %>%\n  head(5)\n\n# --- Step 7: Top 5 counties with largest vulnerable population far from hospitals ---\ntop5_vulpop_far <- agg_county %>%\n  st_drop_geometry() %>%\n  arrange(desc(und_pop)) %>%\n  select(COUNTY_NAM, und_pop, vul_pop, avg_dist_vulnerable) %>%\n  head(5)\n\n# --- Step 8: Display results ---\ntop5_underserved\ntop5_vulpop_far\n```\n+\n\n**Required county-level statistics:**\n- Number of vulnerable tracts\n- Number of underserved tracts  \n- Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved\n- Average distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts\n- Total vulnerable population\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- Which 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts?\n\nBRADFORD\nFOREST\nJUNIATA\nMONROE\nSULLIVAN\n\n- Which counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals?\n\nBRADFORD\nCLEARFIELD\nDAUPHIN\nPOTTER\nCRAWFORD\n\n- Are there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?\n\nThese are typically larger rural counties where population is dispersed and hospitals are sparse.\nUrban counties (like Philadelphia or Allegheny) rarely appear because of dense hospital networks.\n\n---\n\n#### Step 7: Create Summary Table \n\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for healthcare investment.\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r}\n# Create and format priority counties table\nagg_county <- agg_county %>%\n  mutate(\n    z_vul_pop     = scales::rescale(vul_pop),       # vulnerability\n    z_underserved = scales::rescale(pct_vul_underserved), # service deficit\n    z_distance    = scales::rescale(avg_dist_vulnerable), # accessibility\n    priority_score = 0.25*z_vul_pop + 0.1*z_underserved + 0.65*z_distance\n  )\n\npriority_table <- agg_county %>%\n  arrange(desc(priority_score)) %>%\n  slice(1:10) %>%\n  transmute(\n    `County` = COUNTY_NAM,\n    `Priority Score` = round(priority_score*100, 2),\n    `Vulnerable Population` = comma(vul_pop),\n    `Avg.

This analysis should include bringing in your own dataset, ensuring the projection/CRS of your layers align and are appropriate for the analysis (not lat/long or geodetic coordinate systems). The analysis portion should include some combination of spatial and attribute operations to answer a relatively straightforward question**\n\n---\n\n#### Education & Youth Services\n\n**Option A: Educational Desert Analysis**\n- **Data:** Schools, Libraries, Recreation Centers, Census tracts (child population)\n- **Question:** \"Which neighborhoods lack adequate educational infrastructure for children?\"\n- **Operations:** Buffer schools/libraries (0.5 mile walking distance), identify coverage gaps, overlay with child population density\n- **Policy relevance:** School district planning, library placement, after-school program siting\n\n**Option B: School Safety Zones**\n- **Data:** Schools, Crime Incidents, Bike Network\n- **Question:** \"Are school zones safe for walking/biking, or are they crime hotspots?\"\n- **Operations:** Buffer schools (1000ft safety zone), spatial join with crime incidents, assess bike infrastructure coverage\n- **Policy relevance:** Safe Routes to School programs, crossing guard placement\n\n---\n\n#### Environmental Justice\n\n**Option C: Green Space Equity** \n- **Data:** Parks, Street Trees, Census tracts (race/income demographics)\n- **Question:** \"Do low-income and minority neighborhoods have equitable access to green space?\"\n- **Operations:** Buffer parks (10-minute walk = 0.5 mile), calculate tree canopy or park acreage per capita, compare by demographics\n- **Policy relevance:** Climate resilience, environmental justice, urban forestry investment\n---\n\n#### Public Safety & Justice\n\n**Option D: Crime & Community Resources**\n- **Data:** Crime Incidents, Recreation Centers, Libraries, Street Lights\n- **Question:** \"Are high-crime areas underserved by community resources?\"\n- **Operations:** Aggregate crime counts to census tracts or neighborhoods, count community resources per area, spatial correlation analysis\n- **Policy relevance:** Community investment, violence prevention strategies\n---\n\n#### Infrastructure & Services\n\n**Option E: Polling Place Accessibility**\n- **Data:** Polling Places, SEPTA stops, Census tracts (elderly population, disability rates)\n- **Question:** \"Are polling places accessible for elderly and disabled voters?\"\n- **Operations:** Buffer polling places and transit stops, identify vulnerable populations, find areas lacking access\n- **Policy relevance:** Voting rights, election infrastructure, ADA compliance\n\n---\n\n#### Health & Wellness\n\n**Option F: Recreation & Population Health**\n- **Data:** Recreation Centers, Playgrounds, Parks, Census tracts (demographics)\n- **Question:** \"Is lack of recreation access associated with vulnerable populations?\"\n- **Operations:** Calculate recreation facilities per capita by neighborhood, buffer facilities for walking access, overlay with demographic indicators\n- **Policy relevance:** Public health investment, recreation programming, obesity prevention\n\n---\n\n#### Emergency Services\n\n**Option G: EMS Response Coverage**\n- **Data:** Fire Stations, EMS stations, Population density, High-rise buildings\n- **Question:** \"Are population-dense areas adequately covered by emergency services?\"\n- **Operations:** Create service area buffers (5-minute drive = ~2 miles), assess population coverage, identify gaps in high-density areas\n- **Policy relevance:** Emergency preparedness, station siting decisions\n\n---\n\n#### Arts & Culture\n\n**Option H: Cultural Asset Distribution**\n- **Data:** Public Art, Museums, Historic sites/markers, Neighborhoods\n- **Question:** \"Do all neighborhoods have equitable access to cultural amenities?\"\n- **Operations:** Count cultural assets per neighborhood, normalize by population, compare distribution across demographic groups\n- **Policy relevance:** Cultural equity, tourism, quality of life, neighborhood identity\n\n---\n\n### Data Sources\n\n**OpenDataPhilly:** https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/\n- Most datasets available as GeoJSON, Shapefile, or CSV with coordinates\n- Always check the Metadata for a data dictionary of the fields.\n\n**Additional Sources:**\n- **Pennsylvania Open Data:** https://data.pa.gov/\n- **Census Bureau (via tidycensus):** Demographics, economic indicators, commute patterns\n- **TIGER/Line (via tigris):** Geographic boundaries\n\n### Recommended Starting Points\n\n**If you're feeling confident:** Choose an advanced challenge with multiple data layers. \n**If you are a beginner, choose something more manageable that helps you understand the basics**\n\n\n**If you have a different idea:** Propose your own question! Just make sure:\n- You can access the spatial data\n- You can perform at least 2 spatial operations\n\n### Your Analysis\n\n**Your Task:**\n\n1. **Find and load additional data**\n   - Document your data source\n   - Check and standardize the CRS\n   - Provide basic summary statistics\n\n```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=8, dpi=300}\n# Load your additional dataset\n\nphi_school <- read_csv(\"data_2/PaSchoolDistricts2024_03/2025-2026 Master School List (20251001).csv\")\nphi_crime <- read_csv(\"data_2/PaSchoolDistricts2024_03/incidents_part1_part2.csv\")\nbike <- st_read(\"data_2/PaSchoolDistricts2024_03/Bike_Network.shp\")\ncity_limit <- st_read(\"data_2/PaSchoolDistricts2024_03/City_Limits.geojson\")\n\nphi_school <- phi_school %>%\n  separate(`GPS Location`, into = c(\"lat\", \"lng\"), sep = \",\") %>%\n  mutate(\n    lat = as.numeric(lat),\n    lng = as.numeric(lng)\n  )\nphi_crime <- phi_crime %>% drop_na(lng, lat)\n\nst_school <- st_as_sf(phi_school, coords = c(\"lng\", \"lat\"), crs = 4326)\nst_crime <- st_as_sf(phi_crime, coords = c(\"lng\", \"lat\"), crs = 4326)\n\ntarget_crs <- 26918\n\nst_school <- st_transform(st_school, crs = target_crs)\nst_crime  <- st_transform(st_crime,  crs = target_crs)\nbike       <- st_transform(bike, crs = target_crs)\ncity_limit <- st_transform(city_limit, crs = target_crs)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = city_limit, fill = \"grey95\", color = \"grey60\", size = 0.4) + \n  geom_sf(data = bike, color = \"#2b83ba\", size = 0.5) +\n  geom_sf(data = st_school, color = \"coral\", shape = 16, size = 1.2) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Philadelphia Schools, Crime Incidents, and Bike Network\",\n    caption = \"Source: OpenDataPhilly\"\n  ) +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n```\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What dataset did you choose and why?\n\nI choose School List of Philadelphia, Crime Incidents of Philadelphia and Bike Networks.\nI choose these data because it's a question directly related to urban safety and equitable access for students.\n- What is the data source and date?\n\nThe data is from \"opendataphilly.org\" and it is the data of 2025. (date of bike network data is unknown)\n- How many features does it contain?\n\nSchool List contains 1:Administrative info 2:Contact info 3:Location\nCrime Incident contains 1:Time 2:Location 3:Crime category\nBike Networks contains 1:Name 2:road info(type,length,location)\n- What CRS is it in? Did you need to transform it?\n\nThey are all in EPSG:4326 (WGS84).\nYes I need to transform them into another CRS(EPSG:26918) which is more accurate locally.\n\n---\n\n2. **Pose a research question**\n\nWrite a clear research statement that your analysis will answer.\n\nAre schools located in high-crime areas also underserved by safe biking and walking infrastructure?\n**Examples:**\n- \"Do vulnerable tracts have adequate public transit access to hospitals?\"\n- \"Are EMS stations appropriately located near vulnerable populations?\"\n- \"Do areas with low vehicle access have worse hospital access?\"\n\n---\n\n3. **Conduct spatial analysis**\n\nUse at least TWO spatial operations to answer your research question.\n\n**Required operations (choose 2+):**\n- Buffers\n- Spatial joins\n- Spatial filtering with predicates\n- Distance calculations\n- Intersections or unions\n- Point-in-polygon aggregation\n\n**Your Task:**\n```{r, fig.width=10, fig.height=8, dpi=200}\n# Your spatial analysis\n\nst_school <- st_school %>%\n  rename(Publication_Name = `Publication Name`)\nschool_buffers <- st_buffer(st_school, dist = 305)  #
