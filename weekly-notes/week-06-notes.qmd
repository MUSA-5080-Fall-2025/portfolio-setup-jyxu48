## Key Concepts Learned

- Difference between regression for continuous outcomes and classification for binary outcomes
- Logistic regression as a commonly used classification model in policy analysis
- Interpreting probabilities rather than predicted values
- Relationship between model output and decision thresholds

## Coding Techniques

- Fitting logistic regression models in R
- Specifying binary outcomes using formula syntax
- Interpreting model summaries in terms of direction and magnitude
- Generating predicted probabilities from fitted models

## Questions & Challenges

- How to choose appropriate probability thresholds for classification
- Interpreting coefficients in a non-linear model
- Understanding how classification errors affect conclusions

## Connections to Policy

- Classification models are often used for eligibility, risk, or targeting decisions
- Threshold choices can have real consequences for who is included or excluded
- Model uncertainty and error rates are especially important in policy contexts

## Reflection

- Most interesting: framing classification as a decision-support tool rather than a definitive answer
- This week highlighted the ethical implications of binary policy decisions
- I need to be cautious about how model outputs translate into real-world actions
