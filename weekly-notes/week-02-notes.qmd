## Key Concepts Learned

- Data wrangling as a core skill in public policy analytics
- Structure of tidy (long-format) data
- Importance of clear variable definitions and data provenance
- Thinking critically about what data represents before analysis

## Coding Techniques

- Core dplyr verbs: `select()`, `filter()`, `mutate()`, `arrange()`
- Grouped operations using `group_by()` and `summarize()`
- Using pipes (`%>%`) to build readable workflows
- Inspecting data with `glimpse()` and `count()`

## Questions & Challenges

- When to reshape data versus keeping it wide
- Choosing appropriate summary statistics for policy analysis
- Avoiding accidental data loss during filtering and grouping

## Connections to Policy

- Data cleaning decisions directly affect policy conclusions
- Aggregation choices can hide or reveal inequities
- Transparent data transformations are essential for accountability

## Reflection

- Most interesting: how small data-wrangling choices can change results
- Writing readable pipelines makes analysis easier to audit and explain
- I need more practice chaining multiple transformations confidently
