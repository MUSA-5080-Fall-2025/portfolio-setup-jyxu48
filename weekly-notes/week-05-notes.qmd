## Key Concepts Learned

- Importance of evaluating model assumptions after fitting regression
- Role of diagnostics in assessing model reliability
- Difference between model fit and model validity
- Understanding uncertainty and error in regression results

## Coding Techniques

- Examining residuals to assess model behavior
- Using diagnostic plots to check assumptions
- Comparing models using summary measures
- Interpreting diagnostic output alongside coefficients

## Questions & Challenges

- How to decide when a model is “good enough” for policy use
- Interpreting conflicting diagnostic signals
- Knowing when diagnostics suggest revising the model versus rethinking the question

## Connections to Policy

- Model diagnostics affect confidence in policy recommendations
- Ignoring diagnostics can lead to misleading conclusions
- Transparent reporting of model limitations is critical in public contexts

## Reflection

- Most interesting: diagnostics as an integral part of analysis, not an optional step
- This week emphasized caution in trusting numerical results alone
- I need to be more disciplined about checking assumptions before interpretation
