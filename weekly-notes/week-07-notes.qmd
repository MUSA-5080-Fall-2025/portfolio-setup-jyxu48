## Key Concepts Learned

- Importance of evaluating model performance beyond model fitting
- Difference between in-sample fit and out-of-sample performance
- Role of error metrics in assessing model usefulness
- Understanding trade-offs between different types of errors

## Coding Techniques

- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics
- Comparing multiple models based on performance measures
- Interpreting evaluation results rather than optimizing a single metric

## Questions & Challenges

- Choosing evaluation metrics that align with policy goals
- Understanding how performance varies across different populations
- Avoiding over-optimization at the expense of interpretability

## Connections to Policy

- Model performance affects the reliability of policy recommendations
- Different error types can have unequal policy consequences
- Evaluation choices should reflect policy priorities, not just accuracy

## Reflection

- Most interesting: performance evaluation framed as a value-based choice
- This week emphasized that “better” models depend on context and purpose
- I need to be more explicit about why certain evaluation metrics are used
