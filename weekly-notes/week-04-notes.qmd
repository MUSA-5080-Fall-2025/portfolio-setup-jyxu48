## Key Concepts Learned

- Regression as a tool for understanding relationships between variables
- Difference between descriptive analysis and model-based inference
- Interpretation of coefficients in a policy context
- Role of assumptions in linear regression models

## Coding Techniques

- Fitting basic linear regression models in R
- Using formula syntax to specify relationships
- Inspecting model output and key summary statistics
- Separating model estimation from interpretation

## Questions & Challenges

- How to interpret coefficients beyond statistical significance
- Understanding the implications of violated model assumptions
- Distinguishing correlation from causal claims in regression results

## Connections to Policy

- Regression results are often used to justify policy decisions
- Model assumptions can influence policy conclusions if not examined
- Coefficient interpretation must consider real-world context and limitations

## Reflection

- Most interesting: regression framed as an analytical aid, not a source of truth
- This week highlighted the risk of over-interpreting model outputs
- I need to be cautious about how regression results are communicated in policy settings
