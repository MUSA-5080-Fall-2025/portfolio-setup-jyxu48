## Key Concepts Learned

- Recognition of inherent limitations in policy models
- Difference between model usefulness and model completeness
- Importance of stating assumptions, scope, and constraints
- Understanding models as partial representations of reality

## Coding Techniques

- Reviewing model outputs with attention to uncertainty
- Documenting assumptions and known limitations
- Using sensitivity or alternative specifications to test robustness
- Treating limitations as part of the analytical narrative

## Questions & Challenges

- How much limitation disclosure is sufficient in policy work
- Balancing model complexity with interpretability
- Deciding when a model should not be used for decision-making

## Connections to Policy

- Policy misuse can occur when model limits are ignored or minimized
- Explicitly stating limitations supports responsible governance
- Decision-makers need clarity on what models can and cannot inform

## Reflection

- Most interesting: limits framed as an ethical responsibility, not a weakness
- This week reinforced the idea that restraint is part of good analysis
- I need to be more explicit about uncertainty and scope in my work
