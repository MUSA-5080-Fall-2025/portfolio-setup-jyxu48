## Key Concepts Learned

- Role of data visualization in policy analysis and communication
- Difference between exploratory and explanatory visualization
- Importance of audience, context, and intent when designing charts
- Visualization as an analytical decision, not a neutral presentation step

## Coding Techniques

- Using `ggplot2` as the primary visualization framework
- Mapping variables to aesthetics (x, y, color, size)
- Layer-based plotting structure (data, geometry, scales)
- Basic customization to improve readability and interpretation

## Questions & Challenges

- How to balance visual simplicity with analytical completeness
- When visual choices may unintentionally bias interpretation
- Deciding which variables deserve visual emphasis in policy contexts

## Connections to Policy

- Visualizations can shape how policy problems are understood
- Chart design choices influence public perception and decision-making
- Poorly designed visuals can obscure inequities or exaggerate trends

## Reflection

- Most interesting: visualization framed as an ethical and analytical responsibility
- This week reinforced that visuals are part of the analysis, not an afterthought
- I need to be more intentional about why I choose specific chart types
