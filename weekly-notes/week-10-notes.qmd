## Coding Techniques

- Extracting and summarizing key model outputs
- Presenting results in clear, interpretable formats
- Using tables or visual summaries to support explanation
- Separating technical analysis from policy-facing communication

## Questions & Challenges

- How much technical detail is appropriate for different audiences
- Avoiding overstatement of model findings
- Communicating uncertainty without undermining credibility

## Connections to Policy

- Policy decisions depend on how analytical results are framed and explained
- Misinterpretation can lead to misguided or oversimplified policies
- Clear communication supports transparency and informed decision-making

## Reflection

- Most interesting: communication framed as part of analytical responsibility
- This week emphasized that results do not speak for themselves
- I need to be more deliberate about how findings are presented to non-technical audiences
