## Key Concepts Learned

- Policy analytics as an iterative and reflective process
- Importance of integrating modeling, evaluation, fairness, and communication
- Understanding analytics as decision support rather than decision making
- Viewing models as tools embedded in social and institutional contexts

## Coding Techniques

- Integrating multiple analytical steps into a coherent workflow
- Revisiting earlier models with improved evaluation and interpretation
- Treating documentation and explanation as part of the final output
- Preparing analysis for presentation rather than exploration only

## Questions & Challenges

- How to balance technical rigor with real-world constraints
- Knowing when analysis is sufficient to inform action
- Translating analytical work into policy-relevant narratives

## Connections to Policy

- Effective policy analytics requires judgment, not just computation
- Analytical workflows must align with governance, accountability, and equity goals
- The value of analytics depends on how responsibly it is applied

## Reflection

- Most interesting: realizing how much thinking happens *after* the model is run
- This course reframed analytics as a practice, not a checklist
- I now see models less as answers and more as questions generators
- Also learned: if a result seems too clean, it probably deserves another look 🙂
