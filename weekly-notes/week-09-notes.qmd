## Key Concepts Learned

- Recognition that models are not neutral tools
- Sources of bias in data, modeling choices, and evaluation
- Distinction between technical performance and fairness considerations
- Ethical responsibilities in policy-oriented data science

## Coding Techniques

- Examining model outcomes across different groups
- Comparing performance or errors by subgroup
- Using analytical outputs to surface disparities
- Treating fairness analysis as part of the modeling workflow

## Questions & Challenges

- How to define fairness in different policy contexts
- Tension between model accuracy and equity considerations
- Deciding which disparities are acceptable or actionable

## Connections to Policy

- Policy models can reinforce or mitigate existing inequalities
- Fairness concerns are central when models affect access, eligibility, or resources
- Transparency around bias is critical for public trust and accountability

## Reflection

- Most interesting: framing fairness as a policy question, not just a technical one
- This week emphasized that analytical choices carry moral and social weight
- I need to be more explicit about values when interpreting model results
