However, crime exhibits a polycentric distribution. Beyond the city center, we observe significant high-crime clusters in North and West Philadelphia (Kensington/Allegheny).\nThis spatial mismatch suggests that ridership volume alone cannot explain crime risk. While the downtown core attracts crime due to sheer foot traffic (‘Targets’), the peripheral hotspots are likely driven by other environmental factors—such as socioeconomic disadvantage or the presence of crime generators (e.g., alcohol outlets)—rather than transit volume alone."

While the slopes exhibit only minor differences, the methodological value of this split is significant. By comparing the same bus stops during different time periods (Weekday vs. Weekend), we inherently control for static environmental factors, such as poverty rates, street lighting, and proximity to alcohol outlets, which remain constant regardless of the day.\nConsequently, this acts as a quasi-experimental control: since the physical environment is fixed, the persistent upward trend suggests that ridership itself is a direct driver of crime risk. This supports the ‘Targets’ hypothesis over the ‘Eyes on the Street’ theory, indicating that higher passenger volumes attract opportunistic crime regardless of the temporal context."

While we only present the variables with the most significant statistical relationships and policy implications here, this rigorous process of trial and error was essential to ensure the robustness of our final model. The charts above represent the distilled ‘risk signals’ identified from this comprehensive screening.\n\nAlcohol Outlets: The plot shows that crime goes up quickly with the first few alcohol stores. However, as the number of stores gets very high, the line flattens out (Diminishing marginal returns). We will try using a log transformation for this feature. This tells the model that the first few stores have a bigger impact than the later ones.\nStreet Lights: The red trend line is not straight. It goes up as lights increase (usually in busy areas), but then it curves. In later this study, we used a polynomial (2nd degree) term. This allows the model to draw a curved line instead of a straight one to fit the data better.\nDistance to Police: The line looks mostly straight and goes down slightly, so we kept this variable linear.\nPoverty Rate: As poverty goes up, crime generally goes up. The line is mostly straight. We also kept it as a standard linear variable.\nMedian Income: The line looks a bit like a “U” shape. Crime is high in low-income areas, drops in middle-income areas, and rises slightly or stays flat in higher-income areas. We added a squared term (^2). This helps the model understand that crime can be high at both low and high income levels, but low in the middle.\nVacancy Rate: The line looks like an upside-down “U”. Crime goes up as vacancy increases, but when vacancy gets very high (empty neighborhoods), crime actually drops. We also added a squared term (^2) for this."

Additionally, Unemployment Rate (Avg_Unemployment) shows a strong negative correlation with Income (-0.70) and a moderately high positive correlation with Poverty (0.66).\nThese high coefficients suggest that Poverty, Income, and Unemployment are capturing overlapping dimensions of neighborhood socioeconomic status. While this flags a risk of multicollinearity, correlation coefficients alone are insufficient for removing variables. Therefore, we will proceed to calculate the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) in the next step to rigorously quantify the severity of multicollinearity and determine the appropriate strategy for feature selection or transformation."

This pattern suggests that the aggregate demand for public safety resources at these bus stops does not fluctuate significantly throughout the week.\nJustification for Pseudo-Panel Modeling： While this chart shows crime counts are constant, we know that generally ridership volume typically drops on weekends. If the outcome (crime) remains the same while the input (ridership) decreases, it implies that the risk intensity per rider is likely higher on weekends. Constructing a pseudo-panel allows us to mathematically capture this changing elasticity, rather than averaging it out.\n\nBy disaggregating the data into weekday and weekend observations for each stop, we create a pseudo-panel structure that acts as a natural control. Since the physical environment (lighting, poverty, location) remains fixed for a specific stop, splitting the data allows our model to isolate ridership as the primary changing variable, thereby enabling a more robust causal inference about how passenger flows specifically impact crime rates under different density conditions."

It helps us determine if a specific bus stop becomes more dangerous per rider on weekends, even if the total volume of passengers decreases."

Unlike census tracts, PSAs are directly relevant to law enforcement strategy, allowing the model to account for differences in patrolling intensity and reporting practices across different police districts. This approach not only improves model fit but also resolves potential overfitting issues associated with smaller spatial units."

Specifically, Median Income (Avg_Income) exhibited an extremely high Generalized VIF score of 9.92, indicating strong collinearity with Poverty Rate (Avg_Poverty). Including both variables introduces noise and destabilizes coefficient estimates, as they essentially measure the same underlying concept of economic disadvantage.\n\nConsequently, in the transition to Model 6 (Refined Model), we removed Avg_Income and its quadratic term, retaining Avg_Poverty as the primary proxy for socioeconomic status due to its stronger theoretical link to crime risk in urban literature. Additionally, we simplified the Street Lights variable from a polynomial to a linear term (Light_Count). Given that the model includes robust spatial fixed effects (PSA_ID), the complex non-linear variation is already largely absorbed by the spatial controls, making a linear specification for infrastructure more parsimonious and interpretable."

Most importantly, our core variable, Log_Ridership, has a very low GVIF score of 2.13. This is well below the concern threshold (usually 5 or 10), which proves that our main finding that ridership drives crime, is reliable and not distorted by other factors.\n\nHigh scores for Vacancy and the Interaction term are mathematically expected when we use squared terms (like Vacancy^2) or interactions. They do not negatively affect the model’s ability to predict crime."

When reading this chart:\n\nDistance from Red Line: The further the dot is to the right, the stronger the positive impact on crime.\n\nLength of the Line: This represents the Confidence Interval. A longer line means higher uncertainty, often caused by multicollinearity.\n\nModel 1(Ridership Only): Without controlling for any other factors, ridership appears to be a massive driver of crime. However, this estimate is likely inflated (biased) because high-ridership stops are often located in dense, low-income areas. The model is mistakenly attributing the neighborhood effect solely to ridership.\nModel 2(+Interaction): We introduce the Weekend Effect and the interaction term. The main Ridership coefficient increases slightly. This confirms that the relationship isn’t identical across the week. By separating weekends, we begin to see that the “baseline risk” shifts, validating the need for a pseudo-panel approach, though the core finding (ridership = risk) remains consistent due to its positive coefficient.\nModel 3(+Env & Demo): A dramatic shift occurs. The Poverty Rate coefficient appears and is extremely high (purple dot far to the right), while the Ridership coefficient drops significantly (moving left). This is the “Reality Check.” Once we account for poverty, we realize that socioeconomic status is the primary driver of crime, not just the bus stop itself. Ridership is still a significant risk factor (the coefficient is still positive), but its impact is much smaller than Model 1 suggested.\nModel 4(+PSA Fixed Effects): The Poverty Rate coefficient shrinks (moves left, pink dot) compared to Model 3. By adding PSA (Police Service Area) fixed effects, we control for unobserved neighborhood characteristics (like local culture or police presence). The model no longer relies solely on “Poverty” to explain crime clusters, making the estimates for specific variables like Alcohol Outlets and Ridership more precise and trustworthy.\nModel 5(+Lag): The Temporal Lag variable appears at the top with a very high positive coefficient. The strongest predictor of future crime is past crime. Adding this variable absorbs a huge amount of variance, creating a very strict test for our other variables.\nModel 6(Final Refined): Ridership remains positive and significant (approx 0.1), proving that even after controlling for everything (poverty, history, location), more passengers still equal more targets. Alcohol shows a stable positive link. Dist to Police shows a negative coefficient (meaning crime is higher closer to stations), but this is probably because there are bias in original dataset where crimes nearby the police stations are more likely to be recorded."

This parsimonious specification makes the model more stable and interpretable and helps reduce potential multicollinearity among highly correlated socioeconomic variables.\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Report and Compare RMSE, MAE, R²\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(caret)\n\n# 1.

The consistent reduction in MAE and RMSE across folds confirms that the improvements are not artifacts of overfitting but reflect real gains in out-of-sample predictive performance.\nModel 1(Ridership Only)\nThe model using only ridership intensity establishes a basic relationship between human activity levels and crime, but its predictive capacity is limited. Ridership alone captures general exposure but cannot explain spatial heterogeneity across stops.\nModel 2(+ Interaction)\nAdding the weekday–weekend interaction improves the model slightly.\nModel 3(+ Environment&Demographic)\nAlcohol outlet density, Lighting conditions poverty, income, vacancy, and unemployment: these variables substantially reduce prediction error, indicating that crime near transit stops is strongly shaped by both environmental risk factors and neighborhood disadvantage.\nModel 4(+Spatial Fixed)\nIntroducing police station distance and especially PSA fixed effects further improves performance.\nThis suggests that:Crime patterns are partly structured by local policing jurisdictions and there are unobserved spatial factors (culture, enforcement style, land use patterns) that are constant within each PSA.PSA fixed effects absorb these stable spatial characteristics, making the model more robust.\nModel 5(Temporal Lag)\nIncluding lagged crime rate (previous quarter) yields the largest single improvement. Lagged crime captures temporal persistence—areas that experienced more crime in the past tend to remain active in the present.This is a very strong and stable predictor, dramatically improving accuracy.\nModel 6(Refined)\nModel 6 streamlines the specification by removing weaker or collinear variables.Despite using fewer predictors, its accuracy remains nearly identical to Model 5.\nThis indicates that a refined, parsimonious model with reduced multicollinearity can maintain strong predictive performance while improving interpretability and stability."

This is not a model problem; it simply reflects that many stations share the same small crime counts , leading to stacked fitted values. The smooth LOESS line stays close to zero across the range, indicating no strong systematic bias.\nIn short, the residual plot shows that the negative binomial model is behaving as expected for count data, and there is no major evidence of nonlinearity or missing predictors."

As illustrated in our final verdict table, ridership exhibits a consistent, positive, and significant correlation with crime counts (\\(p &lt; 0.001\\)). Specifically, we observed an impact slope of 0.031 for Weekdays (routine commuting) and 0.023 for Weekends (discretionary travel). Crucially, this relationship holds true even after controlling for neighborhood socioeconomic status. This suggests that in Philadelphia, high passenger volume acts primarily as an attractor for opportunistic crime (“Targets”) rather than a deterrent. Therefore, reliance on passive surveillance by crowds is insufficient; active security measures are required as ridership grows."

By calculating the residuals—the difference between actual and predicted crime—we spatially distinguished areas of resource saturation from areas of critical need.\nAs shown in our anomaly maps, the “Over-policed” stops (Red Dots) are heavily clustered in Center City, indicating that current security measures there are suppressing crime below predicted levels. In sharp contrast, we identified the “Top 50 Under-policed Stops” (Blue Dots). These blue anomalies represent locations where actual crime exceeds our model’s predictions by up to 90 incidents—a gap that local environmental factors like poverty or lighting cannot explain. We recommend SEPTA Transit Police utilize this “Hit List” to reallocate patrol units from the saturated downtown core to these specific outlying hotspots. Focusing resources on these specific anomalies yields the highest marginal return on public safety investment.\n\n\n\nCode\n## 7.2.3 Top 10 High-Risk Anomaly Table\n\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\ntop_10_table &lt;- final_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    Predicted = predict(best_model, type = \"response\"),\n    Residual = Crime_Total_Count - Predicted\n  ) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Residual)) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:10) %&gt;%\n  \n  dplyr::select(\n    \"Bus Stop Name\" = Stop,\n    \"Police District (PSA)\" = PSA_ID,\n    \"Actual Crime\" = Crime_Total_Count,\n    \"Model Predicted\" = Predicted,\n    \"Unexplained Excess\" = Residual\n  )\n\nkbl(top_10_table, digits = 1, caption = \"The 'Hit List': Top 10 Stops with Highest Unexplained Crime Risk\") %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\", \"condensed\"), full_width = F) %&gt;%\n  column_spec(5, bold = TRUE, color = \"white\", background = \"#d73027\") %&gt;%\n \n  footnote(general = \" 'Unexplained Excess' = Actual Crime minus Predicted Crime based on local environment.

As detailed in the Top 10 Stops with Highest Unexplained Crime Risk table, the intersection of Locust St & 17th St stands out as the single most critical anomaly, registering 96.8 excess crimes—incidents that simply cannot be attributed to the surrounding built environment. Furthermore, we observe a disturbing systemic pattern in Police Service Area (PSA) 124: it accounts for 5 of the top 10 riskiest locations, particularly along the Whitby Ave and 54th St corridors. This concentration suggests a localized failure in current patrol strategies within PSA 124. We recommend an immediate “security audit” for these ten specific coordinates to identify micro-level drivers of risk—such as broken cameras, blind spots, or unmonitored alcoves—that macro-level data might miss."

    "text": "7.3 Beyond Policing: CPTED Interventions for Long-term Safety\n\nOur model highlights that policing is not the only solution. Built environment features, specifically Street Light Density and Housing Vacancy, were significant predictors of crime risk. The significance of vacancy rates supports the “Broken Windows Theory”—physical disorder invites criminal activity. Therefore, we propose a cross-departmental collaboration between SEPTA and the Philadelphia Department of Streets to prioritize lighting upgrades and blight remediation around high-risk bus stops. These “Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design” (CPTED) interventions offer a sustainable, non-punitive strategy to reduce crime risk without increasing arrest rates."

    "text": "7.4 Equity Concern and Limitations\n\nA major concern in crime modeling is the potential to stigmatize disadvantaged communities. We addressed this by incorporating Census Tract Fixed Effects (Phase 4) and controlling for poverty rates. This ensures our model compares bus stops within the same neighborhood context, rather than unfairly comparing a stop in North Philadelphia to one in Center City. However, we acknowledge that our final model still exhibits some spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s I \\(\\approx\\) 0.29), indicating that unobserved spatial clusters remain.\nWhile the Negative Binomial model effectively handles the over-dispersed count data, future iterations should explore Bayesian Spatial Models to fully resolve the complex spatial dependencies inherent in urban crime data."

The provided scatter plot of Market Value (Predicted) vs. Sale Price (Actual) is an essential diagnostic tool for assessing data quality. - The red line on the plot represents a perfect 1-to-1 relationship (Y=X), where the property’s actual sale price is exactly equal to its predicted market value. While most data points cluster tightly around this line—indicating the “Market Value” is a strong predictor—the plot clearly reveals two distinct types of extreme outliers that do not represent typical market transactions. 1. Removing Non-Market Sales (The Sale Price &lt; 0.05 * Market Value Rule) - There is a dense cluster of points stacked vertically along the y-axis, where Sale Price (X) is near zero, but Market Value (Y) is high (e.g., $1M, $2M, even $4M). These points represent transactions where a property was “sold” for a price that is a tiny fraction of its assessed worth (e.g., a $2,000,000 house sold for $50,000). - These are non-arm’s-length transactions, not true market sales. Examples include sales between family members, inheritance transfers, or other legal transactions where the price does not reflect the market. 2. Removing Anomalous High Sales (The Sale Price &gt; 5 * Market Value Rule) - There are several data points scattered far to the right and bottom of the plot, far below the red Y=X line. These points represent properties where the Sale Price (X) was massively higher than its Market Value (Y). For example, a property with an assessed value of $500,000 (Y) selling for $4,000,000 (X). - These are also not typical sales. They could represent (a) data entry errors, (b) sales where the “Market Value” figure is obsolete (e.g., a run-down property sold for land value/development potential), or (c) properties that underwent major renovations not yet captured in the assessed value. - Retaining these two groups of outliers would severely skew the model’s coefficients and reduce its predictive accuracy for the vast majority of normal, market-based transactions. This filtering rule is a necessary step to clean the data, ensure the model learns from valid transactions, and improve its overall reliability.\n\n1.1.6 enhance the sales data\n\nWe have 8000+ non market transactions, that is 1/4 of the total sales data!

The provided scatter plot of Market Value (Predicted) vs. Sale Price (Actual) is an essential diagnostic tool for assessing data quality. - The red line on the plot represents a perfect 1-to-1 relationship (Y=X), where the property’s actual sale price is exactly equal to its predicted market value. While most data points cluster tightly around this line—indicating the “Market Value” is a strong predictor—the plot clearly reveals two distinct types of extreme outliers that do not represent typical market transactions. 1. Removing Non-Market Sales (The Sale Price &lt; 0.05 * Market Value Rule) - There is a dense cluster of points stacked vertically along the y-axis, where Sale Price (X) is near zero, but Market Value (Y) is high (e.g., $1M, $2M, even $4M). These points represent transactions where a property was “sold” for a price that is a tiny fraction of its assessed worth (e.g., a $2,000,000 house sold for $50,000). - These are non-arm’s-length transactions, not true market sales. Examples include sales between family members, inheritance transfers, or other legal transactions where the price does not reflect the market. 2. Removing Anomalous High Sales (The Sale Price &gt; 5 * Market Value Rule) - There are several data points scattered far to the right and bottom of the plot, far below the red Y=X line. These points represent properties where the Sale Price (X) was massively higher than its Market Value (Y). For example, a property with an assessed value of $500,000 (Y) selling for $4,000,000 (X). - These are also not typical sales. They could represent (a) data entry errors, (b) sales where the “Market Value” figure is obsolete (e.g., a run-down property sold for land value/development potential), or (c) properties that underwent major renovations not yet captured in the assessed value. - Retaining these two groups of outliers would severely skew the model’s coefficients and reduce its predictive accuracy for the vast majority of normal, market-based transactions. This filtering rule is a necessary step to clean the data, ensure the model learns from valid transactions, and improve its overall reliability.\n\n1.1.6 enhance the sales data\n\nWe have 8000+ non market transactions, that is 1/4 of the total sales data!

This means that the majority of houses have lower prices, and very expensive houses are very few in number.\n- Concentration and Outliers: The count of houses in each bin drops rapidly as the price increases. The number of houses above $2,500,000 is very small, indicating the presence of extreme high-price outliers.\n- Preprocessing Requirement: This distribution strongly suggests that before building a house price prediction model, the Sale Price variable will need a transformation, most commonly a log transformation, to make the distribution more closely resemble a normal distribution.\n\n\n3.2 Spatial distribution of sale prices (map)\n\n\nCode\nopa_census_all &lt;- opa_census_all %&gt;%\n  mutate(price_quartile = ntile(sale_price_predicted, 4))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = philly_census, fill = \"lightgrey\", color = \"white\") +\n  geom_sf(data = opa_census_all, aes(color = factor(price_quartile)), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d(\n    option = \"plasma\",\n    direction = -1,\n    labels = c(\"0%-25%\", \"25%-50%\", \"50%-75%\", \"75%-100%\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Housing Sales Price in Philadelphia (2023–2024)\",\n    color = \"Sale Price Quartile\"\n  )  +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 3)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings:\n- Spatial Concentration of Housing Prices: Highest Prices are clearly concentrated in the Center City/Downtown area of Philadelphia and its immediate surroundings, which indicates that the most expensive property transactions occur in the high-value areas of and around the city center.\n- Discontinuous Price Transitions: Housing prices do not exhibit smooth gradients across the city; instead, they show abrupt changes between different price quartiles, forming distinct spatial clusters. This suggests that price variations are influenced by fixed boundaries such as neighborhoods, infrastructure, or socio-economic factors, rather than continuous spatial diffusion. - Peripheral Price Patterns: Lower-price quartiles (0%-25% and 25%-50%) are predominantly located in the outer regions of the city, particularly in the northern and southern peripheries, indicating a clear core-periphery divide in housing values.\n\n\n3.3 Price vs. structural features (scatter plots)\n\n\nCode\nopa_census_plot &lt;- opa_census_all %&gt;%\n  mutate(log_sale_price = log(sale_price_predicted))\n\n# 1️⃣ total_livable_area\np1 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = log(total_livable_area), y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Log(Livable Area)\",\n    x = \"Log(Total Livable Area)\",\n    y = \"Log(Sale Price)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\n# 2️⃣ number_of_bathrooms\np2 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = number_of_bathrooms, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Bathrooms\",\n    x = \"Number of Bathrooms\",  \n    y = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\n# 3️⃣ interior_condition\np3 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = interior_condition, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\", width = 0.2, height = 0) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Interior Condition\",\n    x = \"Interior Condition\",\n    y = \"Log(Sale Price)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\n# 4️⃣ house_age\np4 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = house_age^2, y = log_sale_price)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. House Age²\",\n    x = \"House Age² (2025 - Year Built)²\",\n    y = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\n(p1 + p2) / (p3 + p4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquarto check Key Findings:\n- Strong Positive Correlation with Size and Bathrooms: There is a clear positive linear relationship between the log of sale price and both the log of total livable area and the number of bathrooms. This indicates that larger properties and those with more bathrooms command significantly higher market prices. - Non-Linear Relationship with Interior Condition: While a general positive trend exists, the relationship between log sale price and interior condition rating is not perfectly linear. The data dispersion suggests that the effect of interior condition on price may be subject to diminishing marginal returns or other non-linear dynamics. - Negative Correlation with House Age Squared: A significant negative relationship is observed between log sale price and the squared term of house age. This indicates that property values depreciate as homes get older, and this depreciation effect may accelerate over time, reflecting a non-linear aging effect on housing value.\n\n\n3.4 Price vs. spatial & Social features (scatter plots)\n\n\nCode\nopa_census_plot &lt;- opa_census_all %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    log_sale_price = log(sale_price_predicted),\n    sqrt_crime_count = sqrt(crime_count)\n  )\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = ba_rate, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. BA Rate\",\n       x = \"Bachelor's Degree Rate\", y = \"Log(Sale Price)\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = unemployment_rate, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Unemployment Rate\",\n       x = \"Unemployment Rate\", y = \"\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\np3 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = median_income, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = dollar_format()) +\n  labs(title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Median Income\",\n       x = \"Median Household Income (USD)\", y = \"Log(Sale Price)\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\np4 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = avg_past_price_density, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Past Price Density\",\n       x = \"Average Past Price Density\", y = \"\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\np5 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = sqrt_crime_count, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. √(Crime Count)\",\n       x = \"Square Root of Crime Count\", y = \"Log(Sale Price)\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\np6 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = transit_count, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Transit Count\",\n       x = \"Number of Transit Stops Nearby\", y = \"\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\n(p1 | p2 | p3) / (p4 | p5 | p6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings:\n- Strong Socioeconomic Influence: Housing prices show clear positive correlations with key socioeconomic indicators. Both bachelor’s degree rate and median household income exhibit strong positive relationships with sale prices, indicating that neighborhoods with higher educational attainment and income levels command substantially higher property values. - Negative Impact of Crime and Unemployment: There are evident negative relationships between housing prices and both crime levels (measured by square root of crime count) and unemployment rates. This demonstrates that public safety and local economic vitality are significant determinants of property values in Philadelphia. - Positive Effects of Historical Prices and Transit Access: Sale prices maintain a positive relationship with both historical price density and accessibility to public transportation. This suggests that areas with established high-value characteristics and better transit infrastructure maintain their premium in the housing market, reflecting path dependence in neighborhood valuation and the value of transportation accessibility.\n\n\nOther visualization\n\n\nCode\ntract_price &lt;- opa_census_all %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  group_by(GEOID) %&gt;%\n  summarise(avg_past_price_density = mean(avg_past_price_density, na.rm = TRUE))\n\ntract_map &lt;- philly_census %&gt;%\n  left_join(tract_price, by = \"GEOID\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = tract_map, aes(fill = avg_past_price_density), color = \"white\", size = 0.2) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(\n    low = \"white\", high = \"#6A1B9A\",\n    name = \"Mean Sale Price Per sqft\",\n    labels = scales::dollar_format(),\n    na.value = \"grey60\"\n  ) +\n  scale_alpha(range = c(0.2, 0.8), name = \"Interior Condition\") +\n  \n  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Buffered Area Mean Sold Price of 2022\",\n    subtitle = \"clustered in census tracts\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntract_condition &lt;- opa_census_all %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  group_by(GEOID) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_interior_condition = mean(interior_condition, na.rm = TRUE))\n\ntract_map &lt;- philly_census %&gt;%\n  left_join(tract_condition, by = \"GEOID\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = tract_map, aes(fill = mean_interior_condition), color = \"white\", size = 0.2) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(\n    low = \"#6A1B9A\", high = \"white\",      \n    name = \"Avg Interior Condition\",\n    na.value = \"grey60\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Interior Condition by Census Tract\",\n    subtitle = \"Darker color = better average condition\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntract_area &lt;- opa_census_all %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  group_by(GEOID) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_total_livable_area = mean(total_livable_area, na.rm = TRUE))\n\ntract_map &lt;- philly_census %&gt;%\n  left_join(tract_area, by = \"GEOID\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = tract_map, aes(fill = mean_total_livable_area), color = \"white\", size = 0.2) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(\n    low = \"white\", high = \"#6A1B9A\",   \n    name = \"Avg Livable Area (sqft)\",\n    labels = scales::comma_format(),\n    na.value = \"grey60\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Livable Area by Census Tract\",\n    subtitle = \"Darker color indicates larger average livable area\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings:\n- Spatial Variation in Property Values: The average sale price per square foot shows significant geographic clustering across census tracts, with distinct high-value areas concentrated in specific neighborhoods. This indicates strong spatial autocorrelation in housing prices, where adjacent tracts tend to have similar price levels. - Correlation Between Property Condition and Location: Better average interior conditions are systematically concentrated in particular geographic areas, suggesting that housing maintenance and quality are not randomly distributed but follow spatial patterns that may correlate with neighborhood characteristics and property values. - Heterogeneous Distribution of Housing Size: The average livable area varies substantially across census tracts, with larger properties clustered in specific regions. This spatial patterning of housing size complements the price distribution, indicating that both property characteristics and location factors contribute to the overall housing market structure in Philadelphia."

Combined with the insignificant linear term, this suggests a slight U-shaped relationship, where new homes and very old homes (perhaps with historical value) command a premium over middle-aged homes. - interior_condition (-0.114): Assuming a higher value means worse condition, each one-unit worsening in condition is associated with an 11.4% decrease in price. - quality_grade_num (0.070): Each one-unit increase in the quality grade is associated with a 7.0% increase in price. - fireplaces (0.117): Each additional fireplace is associated with a 11.7% increase in price. - garage_spaces (0.143): Each additional garage space is associated with a 14.3% increase in price. - central_air_dummy (0.458): Homes with central air are estimated to be 45.8% more expensive than the baseline (e.g., no AC). This is a very significant amenity premium. - central_air_missing (-0.230): Homes where central air data is missing are 23.0% cheaper than the baseline.\n4.2 Census variables:\n\n\nCode\nmodel_2 &lt;- lm(log(sale_price_predicted) ~ \n                  log(total_livable_area)  +   #Structural\n                  number_of_bathrooms + \n                  house_age_c +\n                  house_age_c2 +\n                  interior_condition +\n                  quality_grade_num + \n                  fireplaces +\n                  garage_spaces +\n                  central_air_dummy + \n                  central_air_missing+\n                \n                  income_scaled +              #Census\n                  ba_rate +\n                  unemployment_rate,\n  \n              data = opa_census_all,\n              weight=weight_mix\n               )\nsummary(model_2)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = log(sale_price_predicted) ~ log(total_livable_area) + \n    number_of_bathrooms + house_age_c + house_age_c2 + interior_condition + \n    quality_grade_num + fireplaces + garage_spaces + central_air_dummy + \n    central_air_missing + income_scaled + ba_rate + unemployment_rate, \n    data = opa_census_all, weights = weight_mix)\n\nWeighted Residuals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3.2514 -0.1415  0.0546  0.2237  2.0880 \n\nCoefficients:\n                            Estimate   Std.

This suggests Model 1 overestimated the impact of area. Why? Because larger homes are often located in wealthier neighborhoods. Model 1 incorrectly attributed some of the “wealthy neighborhood” premium to “large area.” - quality_grade_num (0.0015 vs 0.070): The coefficient for quality grade became statistically insignificant (p=0.520). This is a key finding: home quality is highly correlated with neighborhood income. Once we directly control for income (income_scaled), the independent effect of quality grade disappears. - central_air_dummy (0.219 vs 0.458): The premium for central air was halved. This also indicates that central air is more common in affluent areas, and Model 1 suffered from significant Omitted Variable Bias (OVB). - New Variable (Census) Interpretation: - income_scaled (0.455): A one-unit increase in standardized census tract income is associated with a 45.5% increase in price. A very strong positive effect. - ba_rate (0.0129): A 1 percentage point increase in the neighborhood’s bachelor’s degree attainment rate is associated with a 1.3% price increase. - unemployment_rate (-0.0066): A 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a 0.66% decrease in price.\n4.3 Spatial features:\n\n\nCode\nmodel_3 &lt;- lm(log(sale_price_predicted) ~ \n                  log(total_livable_area)  +   #Structural\n                  number_of_bathrooms + \n                  house_age_c +\n                  house_age_c2 +\n                  interior_condition +\n                  quality_grade_num + \n                  fireplaces +\n                  garage_spaces +\n                  central_air_dummy + \n                  central_air_missing+\n                \n                  income_scaled +              #Census \n                  ba_rate +\n                  unemployment_rate +\n                \n                  transit_count+\n                  avg_past_price_density+      #Spatial \n                  sqrt(crime_count) +\n                  log(nearest_hospital_knn3),\n              \n              data = opa_census_all,\n              weight=weight_mix\n               )\nsummary(model_3)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = log(sale_price_predicted) ~ log(total_livable_area) + \n    number_of_bathrooms + house_age_c + house_age_c2 + interior_condition + \n    quality_grade_num + fireplaces + garage_spaces + central_air_dummy + \n    central_air_missing + income_scaled + ba_rate + unemployment_rate + \n    transit_count + avg_past_price_density + sqrt(crime_count) + \n    log(nearest_hospital_knn3), data = opa_census_all, weights = weight_mix)\n\nWeighted Residuals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-3.03217 -0.09905  0.05666  0.18464  2.17114 \n\nCoefficients:\n                               Estimate   Std.

This again reveals OVB in Model 2. The large “income” effect in Model 2 was confounded with “spatial amenities”—high-income individuals tend to live in low-crime, accessible areas. - ba_rate (0.0027 vs 0.0129): The education premium also dropped significantly for the same reason. - garage_spaces (0.095 vs 0.170): The garage premium decreased, likely because spatial variables (like density or transit access) have captured related information. - New Variable (Spatial) Interpretation: - transit_count (0.00029): Each additional nearby public transit stop is associated with a 0.029% increase in price. - avg_past_price_density (0.0032): As a proxy for local market heat or locational value, each unit increase is associated with a 0.32% price increase. - sqrt(crime_count) (-0.040): A one-unit increase in the square root of the crime count is associated with a 4.0% decrease in price. - log(nearest_hospital_knn3) (0.087): A 1% increase in the distance from the nearest hospital is associated with a 0.087% increase in price. This suggests people prefer to live further away from hospitals (perhaps to avoid noise, traffic, or sirens), not closer.\n4.4 Interactions and fixed effects:\n\n\nCode\nmodel_4 &lt;- lm(log(sale_price_predicted) ~ \n                  log(total_livable_area)  +   #Structural\n                  number_of_bathrooms + \n                  house_age_c +\n                  house_age_c2 +\n                  interior_condition +\n                  quality_grade_num + \n                  fireplaces +\n                  garage_spaces +\n                  central_air_dummy + \n                  central_air_missing+\n                \n                  income_scaled +              #Census \n                  ba_rate +\n                  unemployment_rate +\n                \n                  transit_count+\n                  avg_past_price_density+      #Spatial \n                  sqrt(crime_count) +\n                  log(nearest_hospital_knn3)+\n                \n                  (interior_condition * income_scaled)+  #FE & Interaction\n                  factor(zip_code),\n              \n              data = opa_census_all,\n              weight=weight_mix\n               )\nsummary(model_4)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = log(sale_price_predicted) ~ log(total_livable_area) + \n    number_of_bathrooms + house_age_c + house_age_c2 + interior_condition + \n    quality_grade_num + fireplaces + garage_spaces + central_air_dummy + \n    central_air_missing + income_scaled + ba_rate + unemployment_rate + \n    transit_count + avg_past_price_density + sqrt(crime_count) + \n    log(nearest_hospital_knn3) + (interior_condition * income_scaled) + \n    factor(zip_code), data = opa_census_all, weights = weight_mix)\n\nWeighted Residuals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-2.86007 -0.09067  0.05500  0.16974  2.17553 \n\nCoefficients:\n                                     Estimate   Std.

It shows that the impact of interior_condition depends on income_scaled. - The total marginal effect of interior_condition is:\\[= -0.1695 + 0.1165 \\times \\text{income\\_scaled}\\] - At the baseline income level (income_scaled = 0), each one-unit worsening in condition is associated with a 17.0% price decrease (-0.1695). However, this penalty is mitigated (lessened) in higher-income areas. For each one-unit increase in income_scaled, the negative penalty of poor condition is reduced by 11.7 percentage points. This may imply that in high-income neighborhoods, “fixer-uppers” (homes in poor condition) are seen as investment opportunities with high renovation potential. Therefore, the market penalty for “poor condition” is smaller."

    "text": "Phase 7: Conclusions & Recommendations\n\nConclusion:\n\nOur final model’s R² is 0.84, indicating that the model explains 84% of the variance in log sale prices. The RMSE is , showing that the model’s predictions are reasonably close to the observed values.\n\nLivable Area of the House matters most for Philadelphia prices.\n\n\n\nRecommendations:\n\nEquity concerns\n\nWhich neighborhoods are hardest to predict?\n\nThe largest prediction errors occur primarily in central Philadelphia, where both overestimation and underestimation coexist within close proximity. This pattern indicates that the model struggles most in areas with high housing heterogeneity- neighborhoods that contain a mix of old row houses, newly renovated apartments, and varying property types within short distances.\nIn contrast, outer neighborhoods such as those in the northwest and northeast tend to have more consistent housing characteristics, leading to smaller residuals. The central tracts’ larger residuals suggest that cultural or historical features have introduced variability that the model’s current features (mainly physical characteristics) cannot fully explain.\n\nAny data bias?\n\nThe observed spatial pattern of prediction errors reflects inherent data bias. The dataset likely overrepresents mid-range housing conditions and underrepresents both luxury and low-income housing. As shown in the livable area and interior condition maps, data coverage in wealthier areas (especially the northwest) is limited, and these tracts often contain more unique, high-value properties that the model cannot generalize well.\n\nWealthier tracts are more likely to be well-documented, while poorer areas lack records, creating spatial imbalance in model performance.\n\nHigh-priced homes typically have larger negotiation margins, meaning their final sale prices are often lower than the listed prices. In contrast, low-priced homes sell closer to their listing prices. As a result, model tends to overestimate expensive homes and underestimate affordable ones, introducing systematic bias.\n\n\nRecommendations to government\n\n\nImmediate System Calibration: We recommend utilizing our model’s findings to immediately adjust property assessments in systematically overvalued low-income communities. This action will ensure a fair distribution of the tax burden and address current inequities.\nIntegrate Advanced Spatial Features: We advise the Office of Property Assessment (OPA) to permanently integrate the effective spatial characteristics identified by our study—specifically Comparable Sales Proxies (surrounding transaction prices) and Neighborhood Fixed Effects—into the next-generation AVM. This will significantly enhance the model’s responsiveness to rapidly changing market dynamics.\nExtreme high values almost exclusively stem from corporate transactions and require manual review for outliers.\n\n\nLimitations and nest steps\n\nLimitations: Inherent Data Biases\n\nOur predictive accuracy is constrained by inherent data biases which affect equity. We find a dual challenge in data coverage: in affluent areas, high-value, unique properties suffer from data sparsity, making generalization difficult. Conversely, lower-income areas often show data incompleteness, leading to less reliable predictions and higher residual errors. Critically, we observed a price-tier bias: high-priced homes tend to sell below their list price, while low-priced homes transact closer to it. This systemic pattern means the model is prone to over-assessing expensive properties and under-assessing affordable ones, creating a structural risk for vertical inequity in the tax system.\n\nNext Steps: Enhancing Data Quality and Fairness\n\nTo address these limitations, our next steps focus on data enrichment and equitable optimization. The City should partner with us to integrate non-public data, such as detailed appraisal records and permit data, which can account for unobserved renovation quality and close the data gap. Furthermore, to combat the systematic price-tier bias, we recommend integrating fairness metrics directly into the AVM’s optimization process. This will shift the model’s objective beyond simple average accuracy (RMSE) to ensure that prediction errors are uniformly low across all price tiers and all Philadelphia neighborhoods, securing both accuracy and equity."

    "text": "Exploratory Analysis\nWe aggregated individual trip records by date to obtain total daily ridership, then used ggplot2 to plot a time-series line chart with a smoothed trend line to visualize how Indego bike-share demand changed over the third quarter of 2024.\n\nTrips Over Time\n\n\nCode\n# Daily trip counts\ndaily_trips &lt;- indego_q3 %&gt;%\n  group_by(date) %&gt;%\n  summarize(trips = n())\n\nggplot(daily_trips, aes(x = date, y = trips)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#3182bd\", linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Indego Daily Ridership - Q3 2024\",\n    subtitle = \"Winter demand patterns in Philadelphia\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Daily Trips\",\n    caption = \"Source: Indego bike share\"\n  ) +\n  plotTheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation:\nThe first pattern is the weekly heartbeat. Those sharp peaks and valleys repeat with metronomic regularity. Indego always dips on the same days each week, typically weekends, because commuting demand relaxes\nThen there’s the gentle seasonal slope underneath that weekly pulse. Early July starts relatively high, and then the baseline slowly drifts downward into early August (Maybe because of the summer vocation). Mid-August shows a little recovery, followed by a September lift since the fall semester began. Before the season’s first chilly whisper pushes ridership down again heading into October.\n\n\nHourly Patterns\n\n\nCode\n# Average trips by hour and day type\nhourly_patterns &lt;- indego_q3 %&gt;%\n  group_by(hour, weekend) %&gt;%\n  summarize(avg_trips = n() / n_distinct(date)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(day_type = ifelse(weekend == 1, \"Weekend\", \"Weekday\"))\n\nggplot(hourly_patterns, aes(x = hour, y = avg_trips, color = day_type)) +\n  geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"Weekday\" = \"#08519c\", \"Weekend\" = \"#6baed6\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Hourly Ridership Patterns\",\n    subtitle = \"Clear commute patterns on weekdays\",\n    x = \"Hour of Day\",\n    y = \"Average Trips per Hour\",\n    color = \"Day Type\"\n  ) +\n  plotTheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation:\nOn weekdays, the peaks are tied to commuting: A morning spike around 8–9 AM, when the city jolts awake and people pedal to work. A bigger afternoon/evening spike around 5–6 PM, the classic homebound surge. The slope up to these points is steep, like a heartbeat aligned with office life. On weekends, the rhythm relaxes. There’s no sharp, early-morning people are not rushing anywhere. Ridership climbs more slowly through the morning toward a broad mid-day plateau, roughly 11 AM to 3 PM, and then drifts downward without the evening spike seen on weekdays.\nSo the pattern suggests that weekday trips are purposeful and synchronized with the workday, while weekend trips stretch out across the middle of the day in a more leisurely wave.\n\n\nTop Stations\n\n\nCode\n# Most popular origin stations\ntop_stations &lt;- indego_q3 %&gt;%\n  count(start_station, start_lat, start_lon, name = \"trips\") %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(trips)) %&gt;%\n  head(20)\n\nkable(top_stations, \n      caption = \"Top 20 Indego Stations by Trip Origins\",\n      format.args = list(big.mark = \",\")) %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"))\n\n\n\nTop 20 Indego Stations by Trip Origins\n\n\nstart_station\nstart_lat\nstart_lon\ntrips\n\n\n\n\n3,010\n39.94711\n-75.16618\n6,654\n\n\n3,032\n39.94527\n-75.17971\n5,436\n\n\n3,244\n39.93865\n-75.16674\n4,421\n\n\n3,054\n39.96250\n-75.17420\n4,305\n\n\n3,359\n39.94888\n-75.16978\n4,305\n\n\n3,296\n39.95134\n-75.16758\n4,252\n\n\n3,101\n39.94295\n-75.15955\n4,226\n\n\n3,020\n39.94855\n-75.19007\n4,154\n\n\n3,295\n39.95028\n-75.16027\n4,144\n\n\n3,066\n39.94561\n-75.17348\n4,114\n\n\n3,059\n39.96244\n-75.16121\n4,022\n\n\n3,022\n39.95472\n-75.18323\n3,954\n\n\n3,362\n39.94816\n-75.16226\n3,948\n\n\n3,163\n39.94974\n-75.18097\n3,942\n\n\n3,028\n39.94061\n-75.14958\n3,921\n\n\n3,208\n39.95048\n-75.19324\n3,919\n\n\n3,061\n39.95425\n-75.17761\n3,796\n\n\n3,046\n39.95012\n-75.14472\n3,734\n\n\n3,063\n39.94633\n-75.16980\n3,726\n\n\n3,185\n39.95169\n-75.15888\n3,678"

Compared to the baseline hour (midnight), coefficients rise sharply in the morning and peak around the late afternoon, matching the commuter pattern observed earlier. Day-of-week effects are smaller but still significant: mid-week days tend to have slightly higher ridership, while weekends show lower counts. Weather matters too—higher temperatures slightly reduce trips, and precipitation has a larger negative effect. Although all predictors are statistically significant (given the huge sample size), the model explains only about 11% of the variation, meaning most hour-to-hour fluctuations are driven by other unmeasured factors such as station-specific conditions or random demand swings.\n\n\nModel 2: Add Temporal Lags\n\n\nCode\nmodel2 &lt;- lm(\n  Trip_Count ~ as.factor(hour) + dotw_simple + Temperature + Precipitation +\n    lag1Hour + lag3Hours + lag1day,\n  data = train\n)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel_metrics_lm(model2, test_data = test)\n\n\nModel: model2 \n  Type:               OLS \n  R-squared (train):  0.3318 \n  Adj R-squared:      0.3317 \n  MAE (train):        0.6655 \n  MAE (test):         0.6857 \n\n\nInterpretation:\nThe model still captures the usual hourly and day-of-week ridership patterns, but the major change comes from adding the lagged demand terms. The one-hour lag has the strongest effect—stations that were busy an hour ago are much more likely to be busy now. The three-hour lag and the previous-day same-hour lag also contribute meaningful predictive power. Weather remains significant but plays a smaller role. Overall model fit improves substantially: R² rises from about 0.11 to about 0.33, and residual error drops, showing that including recent past demand explains much more of the variation. This confirms that short-term station activity is strongly tied to its own immediate history.\n\n\nModel 3: Add Demographics\nThis model captures neighborhood effects on demand\n\n\nCode\nmodel3 &lt;- lm(\n  Trip_Count ~ as.factor(hour) + dotw_simple + Temperature + Precipitation +\n    lag1Hour + lag3Hours + lag1day +\n    Med_Inc.y + Percent_Taking_Transit.y + Percent_White.y,\n  data = train\n)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel_metrics_lm(model3, test_data = test)\n\n\nModel: model3 \n  Type:               OLS \n  R-squared (train):  0.3373 \n  Adj R-squared:      0.3373 \n  MAE (train):        0.6673 \n  MAE (test):         0.6868 \n\n\nInterpretation:\nThe R square means the model explains about 34% of hourly variation in bike demand.Adding demographics raises R² slightly compared to Model 2, they help, but only modestly.Temporal lags dominate the model, while demographics show systematic spatial patterns. All three demographic variables are all significant, and it shows that demographics matter, but compared to temporal lags and hour-of-day, their effect sizes are small.\n\n\nModel 4: Add Station Fixed Effects\n\n\nCode\nmodel4 &lt;- lm(\n  Trip_Count ~ as.factor(hour) + dotw_simple + Temperature + Precipitation +\n    lag1Hour + lag3Hours + lag1day +\n    Med_Inc.y + Percent_Taking_Transit.y + Percent_White.y +\n    as.factor(start_station),\n  data = train\n)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel_metrics_lm(model4, test_data = test)\n\n\nModel: model4 \n  Type:               OLS \n  R-squared (train):  0.3627 \n  Adj R-squared:      0.3624 \n  MAE (train):        0.6667 \n  MAE (test):         0.6831 \n\n\nInterpretation:\nModel 4 adds a dummy variable for every station, letting the model control for unobserved station-specific factors. It shows that station-specific factors are strong drivers of bike-share demand. Adding fixed effects significantly boosts the model’s ability to explain past variation, but the improvement does not reliably boost predictive accuracy. Even though R² increases, the model’s MAE does not improve much. Because station fixed effects are great for explaining historical data, but they don’t generalize as well when predicting new periods.\n\n\nModel 5: Add Rush Hour Interaction\n\n\nCode\nmodel5 &lt;- lm(\n  Trip_Count ~ as.factor(hour) + dotw_simple + Temperature + Precipitation +\n    lag1Hour + lag3Hours + lag1day + rush_hour + as.factor(month) +\n    Med_Inc.y + Percent_Taking_Transit.y + Percent_White.y +\n    as.factor(start_station) +\n    rush_hour * weekend,  # Rush hour effects different on weekends\n  data = train\n)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel_metrics_lm(model5, test_data = test)\n\n\nModel: model5 \n  Type:               OLS \n  R-squared (train):  0.3669 \n  Adj R-squared:      0.3665 \n  MAE (train):        0.6653 \n  MAE (test):         0.6833 \n\n\nInterpretation:\nModel 5 introduces an interaction between rush hour and weekends, allowing the model to differentiate the strong weekday commuting peaks from the much softer weekend patterns. It also adds month effects to capture seasonal shifts across July, August, and September. Even though Model 5 has the highest R², it performs worse on the test set. This indicates that Model 5 is overfit: it explains historical variation better but loses forecasting accuracy. Model 4 remains the best balance of simplicity and predictive accuracy."

    "text": "Compare results to Q1 2025:\n\n\n1. How do the MAE values compare across quarters?\nQ1 2025 MAE values are generally lower than those we reported for Q3 2024.\nSo predictions in Q1 are simply easier.\n\n\n2. Why might they differ?\nWinter(Q1) has smoother, more predictable demand: Riders may behave more consistently in colder months. There are fewer tourists. Weather is cold but stable—more consistently low temperatures, fewer big swings.\nSummer(Q3) is noisy and harder to predict: Weather-driven volatility: heat waves, thunderstorms, humidity. More variation in leisure rides, weekend trips, and irregular patterns. Tourism and events add bursts of unpredictable activity.\nSo the model in Q3 faces more randomness, and MAE naturally rises.\n\n\n3. Are temporal patterns different (summer vs. winter)?\nYes. In winter, ridership follows a tighter, more predictable rhythm. The daily totals rise gradually from January into March without the big, volatile spikes that appear in summer. Hourly patterns also become cleaner: weekday mornings and evenings show sharp commuter peaks, while weekends stay much flatter with only a modest mid-day bump. By contrast, summer brings stronger mid-day activity, higher weekend volume, and much more weather-driven noise. Winter demand is steadier and more commute-oriented, whereas summer mixes commuting with a large amount of leisure riding, creating far more variation.\n\n\n4. Which features are most important in your quarter?\nTemporal lags. The results show a large performance jump when lag variables (1 hour, 3 hours, 1 day) are added. Summer ridership changes quickly with events, weather shifts, and bursts of leisure activity."

Those periods have fewer big swings and smaller trip counts, so the model can track the pattern closely. On weekends—when demand is generally smoother—the points cluster tightly and the green line stays close to the red line. The model doesn’t dramatically over- or under-shoot in these calmer periods.\nWhere the model struggles: It struggles during high-demand commuter windows, especially the AM and PM rush hours. In these panels, the cloud of points stretches upward far past the green line, showing that the model systematically under-predicts the busiest moments. Sharp surges in demand are hard to anticipate with simple temporal lags, so the model tends to flatten out the peaks. There is also more scatter on weekday rush hours than on weekends, reflecting the added variability of work-day travel.\nIn conclusion, the model handles routine, low-volume times well, but it misses the sudden spikes that define heavy commuting periods."

The trend line slopes upward: as median income increases, MAE tends to rise a bit. This likely reflects busier, more mixed-use areas where demand is less predictable.\nNeighborhoods with high transit use show lower errors. Stations located in areas with more transit riders tend to have lower MAE. Transit-heavy areas typically have more stable, commute-driven travel patterns that are easier for the model to predict.\nStations in whiter neighborhoods show slightly higher errors. The relationship is mild, but the upward slope suggests that stations in predominantly white, higher-income areas may see more inconsistent demand—often driven by leisure or irregular trip purposes."

    "section": "Feature Selection and Engineering",
    "text": "Feature Selection and Engineering\nFrom the error analysis above, we noticed that stations with large prediction errors are concentrated in Center City. From the data structure, we also know that the distribution of Trip_Count is highly skewed. There are many observations with 0 or 1 trip and a few observations with very large counts. The large number of 0 or 1 counts makes the model under-predict for high values. The extreme large counts make the model over-predict for low values. This creates a structural bias that we cannot fully remove.\nTo address this, we want to add variables that can detect and partially adjust for this pattern. Distance to Center City is a natural candidate. It can help the model sense the spatial structure behind these errors. However, the station dummy variables may already capture most of the distance differences. Therefore, the distance variable needs to be transformed or used in interaction terms to avoid collinearity with the station fixed effects.\nWhen we examine the trip-count-over-time plots, we also see spikes that appear irregularly. These spikes may reflect special events that disrupt the usual demand pattern. They do not happen often, but they can create extreme values and break the roughly linear relationship that the model tries to learn. This can have a strong impact on model performance. Federal holidays are one potential source of such events. The current model does not include enough variables to detect these effects.\nBased on these observations, we decide to add two new variables:\n1.Holiday indicator\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\nstudy_panel_complete &lt;- study_panel_complete %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    # Convert datetime column to Date\n    date = as.Date(interval60),\n\n    # Weekday with Monday = 1, Tuesday = 2, ..., Sunday = 7\n    wday_mon = wday(date, week_start = 1),\n    \n    # US Federal Holidays (rule-based, works for any year)\n    \n    # New Year's Day: January 1st\n    holiday_newyear = month(date) == 1  & mday(date) == 1,\n\n    # Martin Luther King Jr. Day: 3rd Monday in January\n    holiday_mlk = month(date) == 1 &\n                  wday_mon == 1 &        \n                  mday(date) &gt;= 15 & mday(date) &lt;= 21,\n\n    # Presidents’ Day: 3rd Monday in February\n    holiday_pres = month(date) == 2 &\n                   wday_mon == 1 &       \n                   mday(date) &gt;= 15 & mday(date) &lt;= 21,\n\n    # Memorial Day: last Monday in May (Monday on or after the 25th)\n    holiday_memorial = month(date) == 5 &\n                       wday_mon == 1 &     \n                       mday(date) &gt;= 25,\n\n    # Independence Day: July 4th\n    holiday_july4 = month(date) == 7 & mday(date) == 4,\n\n    # Labor Day: 1st Monday in September (Monday between 1st and 7th)\n    holiday_labor = month(date) == 9 &\n                    wday_mon == 1 &        \n                    mday(date) &lt;= 7,\n\n    # Thanksgiving: 4th Thursday in November\n    holiday_thanks = month(date) == 11 &\n                     wday_mon == 4 &              # Thursday\n                     mday(date) &gt;= 22 & mday(date) &lt;= 28,\n\n    # Christmas Day: December 25th\n    holiday_xmas = month(date) == 12 & mday(date) == 25,\n\n    # Combined holiday indicator: 1 if any of the above holidays, 0 otherwise\n    holiday_any = as.integer(\n      holiday_newyear | holiday_mlk | holiday_pres |\n      holiday_memorial | holiday_july4 | holiday_labor |\n      holiday_thanks | holiday_xmas\n    )\n  )\n\n\n2.Distance to Center City\n\n\nCode\n# 1.

    "text": "Model Improvement\n\nModel 6: Adjust variables in model 4\nIn this model, we refine some existing variables and use the result as the second baseline for later improved models.\nFirst, based on the summary of Model 4, we noticed that the Precipitation variable did not perform well. However, rain conditions should be an important factor for bike demand. The original variable is very small in magnitude because the total amount of rain is spread across 24 hours. To better capture the effect of rain, we transform it into two dummy variables that indicate whether it is rainy and whether it is raining heavily.\nSecond, we believe the weekend indicator is important because the demand pattern on weekends is different from weekdays. In the previous model, it did not work well because the interaction term weekend:rush_hour is highly collinear with as.factor(hour). To keep the weekend/weekday effect in the model, we replace this term with the interaction as.factor(hour):weekend.\n\n\nCode\nmodel6 &lt;- lm(\n  Trip_Count ~ as.factor(hour)* weekend + dotw_simple + \n    Temperature + \n    Rain_any + Heavy_rain +\n    lag1Hour + lag3Hours + lag1day  + \n    as.factor(month) + \n    Med_Inc.y + Percent_Taking_Transit.y + Percent_White.y + \n    as.factor(start_station),  # Rush hour effects different on weekends\n  data = train\n)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel_metrics_lm(model6, test_data = test)\n\n\nModel: model6 \n  Type:               OLS \n  R-squared (train):  0.3702 \n  Adj R-squared:      0.3698 \n  MAE (train):        0.664 \n  MAE (test):         0.6783 \n\n\nInterpretation:\nModel 6 serves as our second baseline model after refining several key predictors.\nOn weekdays, the model shows strong morning and evening peaks that are consistent with commuting.\nOn weekends, the peaks flatten and shift toward the middle of the day.\nThe new rain dummies behave as expected: both rainy and heavy-rain hours are associated with lower trip counts compared with dry conditions.\nDemographics and station fixed effects mainly shift the overall level of demand at each station, while the refined weather and weekend terms improve the shape of the predicted time profile without a large change in overall MAE.\n\n\nModel 7: Add Holiday Indicator and Distance to center city Interation\nThis model is based on Model 6 and adds two new components: a holiday indicator and an interaction between distance to Center City and rush hour. As discussed above, the interaction term is not only used to capture the relationship between distance and peak-hour demand, but also to reduce collinearity with the station fixed effects. Adding these two variables may help the model better detect structural patterns in the data and improve overall performance.\n\n\nCode\nmodel7 &lt;- lm(\n  Trip_Count ~ as.factor(hour)* weekday + \n    dotw_simple + \n    Temperature + \n    Rain_any + Heavy_rain +\n    lag1Hour + lag3Hours + lag1day  + \n    as.factor(month) + \n    Med_Inc.y + Percent_Taking_Transit.y + Percent_White.y + \n    dist_center_m*rush_hour  +                              # interaction\n    holiday_any +                                           # holiday indicator\n    as.factor(start_station),  \n  data = train\n)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel_metrics_lm(model7, test_data = test)\n\n\nModel: model7 \n  Type:               OLS \n  R-squared (train):  0.3751 \n  Adj R-squared:      0.3748 \n  MAE (train):        0.6584 \n  MAE (test):         0.6762 \n\n\nInterpretation:\nModel 7 builds on Model 6 by adding two variables that are motivated directly by our error analysis and knowledge of Philadelphia’s spatial and temporal structure: a holiday indicator and an interaction between distance to Center City and rush hour. The idea is that holidays and downtown peak periods are exactly when we observed the largest systematic errors in previous models. These additions slightly improve performance: the test MAE decreases from 0.6783 in Model 6 to 0.6762 in Model 7, and (R^2) rises only marginally from 0.3702 to 0.3751. This shows that, even after trying to encode what we learned about the error patterns, urban form, and time-of-day effects into new variables, most of the predictive power still comes from the core ingredients introduced earlier (time of day, temporal lags, and station fixed effects). The remaining errors are likely driven by noise and unobserved factors—such as special events or local disruptions—that are difficult to capture with simple linear terms.\n\n\nModel 8: Try a poisson model for count data (base on model 7)\nIn addition to the linear regression models, we also estimate a Poisson regression with a log link to better reflect the count nature of the bike trip data. For this specification, we keep the same set of predictors as in Model 7 and only change the estimation method from OLS to Poisson. This allows us to directly compare the two approaches under an identical model structure. The Poisson model serves as a robustness check: it tests whether the main effects of time-of-day, weekend, weather, lagged demand, distance to Center City, and holidays remain consistent when we use a count model that is more appropriate for non-negative integer outcomes.\n\n\nCode\n# Poisson model with log link\npoisson_model7 &lt;- glm(\n  Trip_Count ~ \n    as.factor(hour) * weekday +       \n    dotw_simple +                     \n    Temperature + Rain_any + Heavy_rain +\n    lag1Hour + lag3Hours + lag1day +\n    as.factor(month) +\n    Med_Inc.y + Percent_Taking_Transit.y + Percent_White.y +\n    dist_center_m*rush_hour +          \n    holiday_any +\n    as.factor(start_station),\n  family = poisson(link = \"log\"),\n  data = train\n)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel_metrics_lm(poisson_model7, test_data = test)\n\n\nModel: poisson_model7 \n  Type:               Poisson \n  R-squared (train):  0.3828 \n  Adj R-squared:      0.3824 \n  MAE (train):        0.6221 \n  MAE (test):         0.6461 \n\n\nInterpretation:\nFinally, we re-estimate Model 7 using a Poisson regression with a log link while keeping exactly the same set of predictors. This change in estimation method leads to a modest but clear improvement in predictive performance: the test MAE decreases from 0.6762 in the OLS version of Model 7 to 0.6461 in the Poisson model, and the (R^2) on the training set increases slightly from 0.3751 to 0.3828. The Poisson specification fits the count nature of bike trips better and reduces some of the systematic under- and over-prediction we saw in the linear model, but the gain is not dramatic, which suggests that most remaining errors are due to noise and unobserved shocks rather than the choice between OLS and Poisson."

Poisson using variables in model 7\n0.6461\n22.1\n4.7\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation:\nFrom Model 3 to Model 7, we keep adding more variables and refining the specification, but the improvement over Model 2 is quite limited. After including temporal lags in Model 2, the MAE already drops from 0.83 to about 0.69 trips, and this remains the dominant gain. Models 3–5 add demographics, station fixed effects, and a rush-hour interaction, and Models 6–7 further adjust weather, weekend, distance, and holiday variables. However, the MAE stays in a very narrow range around 0.68–0.676, which is only a small improvement compared to Model 2.\nThis pattern suggests that once we control for time-of-day and recent demand history, most additional predictors only provide marginal extra information for short-term station-level demand. Demographics and station dummies mainly shift overall levels rather than change hour-to-hour variation, and the added interaction terms capture more subtle structure but do not drastically reduce prediction error on the test set.\nIn contrast, Model 8 changes the estimation method rather than the predictor set. It applies a Poisson regression using the same variables as Model 7. This shift to a count model leads to a more noticeable improvement: the MAE decreases to 0.6461 trips, which is substantially better than the OLS models with the same predictors. This indicates that better matching the distributional form of the outcome (non-negative counts) can yield additional gains even when the set of explanatory variables is already rich.\n\nVisualize Model Comparison\n\n\nCode\nggplot(mae_results2, aes(x = reorder(Model, -MAE), y = MAE)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#3182bd\",alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = round(MAE, 4)), vjust = -0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Model Performance Comparison\",\n    subtitle = \"Lower MAE = Better Predictions\",\n    x = \"Model\",\n    y = \"Mean Absolute Error (trips)\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))\n  ) +\n  plotTheme +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))"

This suggests that while most of Pennsylvania’s vulnerable areas have reasonable healthcare access, a few rural or remote tracts still face significant geographic barriers to medical services.\n\n\n\nStep 6: Aggregate to County Level\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.\nYour Task:\n\npa_county &lt;- st_transform(pa_county, crs=26917)\nvul_center&lt;- st_transform(vul_center, crs=st_crs(pa_county))\n\nst_county &lt;- st_join(\n  pa_county,\n  vul_center,\n  join  = st_contains,\n  left  = TRUE                # keep all counties\n)\n\n# Aggregate statistics by county\n\nagg_county &lt;- st_county %&gt;%\n  group_by(COUNTY_NAM) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    vul_count= sum(vulnerable),\n    und_count= sum(underserved),\n    pct_vul_underserved = 100 * sum(vulnerable & underserved) / sum(vulnerable),\n    avg_dist_vulnerable = mean(dist_mi[vulnerable], na.rm = TRUE),\n    vul_pop = sum(total_pop[vulnerable]),\n    und_pop = sum(total_pop[underserved])\n  )\n\nagg_county &lt;- agg_county %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~replace(., is.na(.), 0)))\nagg_county\n\nSimple feature collection with 67 features and 7 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 539820.7 ymin: 4396937 xmax: 1034915 ymax: 4680425\nProjected CRS: NAD83 / UTM zone 17N\n# A tibble: 67 × 8\n   COUNTY_NAM vul_count und_count pct_vul_underserved avg_dist_vulnerable\n * &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 ADAMS              0         0                   0                0   \n 2 ALLEGHENY         22         0                   0                2.84\n 3 ARMSTRONG          1         0                   0               10.0 \n 4 BEAVER             5         0                   0                2.83\n 5 BEDFORD            2         0                   0                7.97\n 6 BERKS              0         0                   0                0   \n 7 BLAIR              3         0                   0                3.07\n 8 BRADFORD           1         1                 100               16.7 \n 9 BUCKS              0         0                   0                0   \n10 BUTLER             0         0                   0                0   \n# ℹ 57 more rows\n# ℹ 3 more variables: vul_pop &lt;dbl&gt;, und_pop &lt;dbl&gt;, geometry &lt;MULTIPOLYGON [m]&gt;\n\n\n\n# --- Step 6: Top 5 counties with highest % of underserved vulnerable tracts ---\ntop5_underserved &lt;- agg_county %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(pct_vul_underserved)) %&gt;%\n  select(COUNTY_NAM, pct_vul_underserved, vul_count, und_count) %&gt;%\n  head(5)\n\n# --- Step 7: Top 5 counties with largest vulnerable population far from hospitals ---\ntop5_vulpop_far &lt;- agg_county %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(und_pop)) %&gt;%\n  select(COUNTY_NAM, und_pop, vul_pop, avg_dist_vulnerable) %&gt;%\n  head(5)\n\n# --- Step 8: Display results ---\ntop5_underserved\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n  COUNTY_NAM pct_vul_underserved vul_count und_count\n  &lt;chr&gt;                    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 BRADFORD                   100         1         1\n2 FOREST                     100         1         1\n3 JUNIATA                    100         1         1\n4 MONROE                     100         1         1\n5 SULLIVAN                   100         1         1\n\ntop5_vulpop_far\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 4\n  COUNTY_NAM und_pop vul_pop avg_dist_vulnerable\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 BRADFORD      5466    5466               16.7 \n2 CLEARFIELD    5285   13056               11.4 \n3 DAUPHIN       4392    8410                9.96\n4 POTTER        4257    9062                9.55\n5 CRAWFORD      2842    9072                8.35\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired county-level statistics: - Number of vulnerable tracts - Number of underserved tracts\n- Percentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved - Average distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts - Total vulnerable population\nQuestions to answer: - Which 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts?\nBRADFORD FOREST JUNIATA MONROE SULLIVAN\n\nWhich counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals?\n\nBRADFORD CLEARFIELD DAUPHIN POTTER CRAWFORD\n\nAre there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?\n\nThese are typically larger rural counties where population is dispersed and hospitals are sparse.

Yes I need to transform them into another CRS(EPSG:26918) which is more accurate locally.\n\n\nPose a research question\n\nWrite a clear research statement that your analysis will answer.\nAre schools located in high-crime areas also underserved by safe biking and walking infrastructure? Examples: - “Do vulnerable tracts have adequate public transit access to hospitals?” - “Are EMS stations appropriately located near vulnerable populations?” - “Do areas with low vehicle access have worse hospital access?”\n\n\nConduct spatial analysis\n\nUse at least TWO spatial operations to answer your research question.\nRequired operations (choose 2+): - Buffers - Spatial joins - Spatial filtering with predicates - Distance calculations - Intersections or unions - Point-in-polygon aggregation\nYour Task:\n\n# Your spatial analysis\n\nst_school &lt;- st_school %&gt;%\n  rename(Publication_Name = `Publication Name`)\nschool_buffers &lt;- st_buffer(st_school, dist = 305)  # 1000 ft ≈ 305 m\n\ncrime_in_buffer &lt;- st_join(st_crime, school_buffers, join = st_within)\n\ncrime_summary &lt;- crime_in_buffer %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  group_by(Publication_Name) %&gt;%\n  summarise(crime_n = n())\n\n# Spatial intersection: calculate total length of bike network inside each buffer\nbike_in_buffer &lt;- st_intersection(bike, school_buffers)\n\nbike_summary &lt;- bike_in_buffer %&gt;%\n  group_by(Publication_Name) %&gt;%\n  summarise(bike_length_m = sum(st_length(geometry))) %&gt;%\n  mutate(bike_length_mi = set_units(bike_length_m, \"mi\"))\n\n# Combine results into a single summary table\nschool_safety &lt;- school_buffers %&gt;%\n  left_join(st_drop_geometry(crime_summary), by = \"Publication_Name\") %&gt;%\n  left_join(st_drop_geometry(bike_summary),  by = \"Publication_Name\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    crime_n = replace_na(crime_n, 0),\n    bike_length_mi = replace_na(as.numeric(bike_length_mi), 0),\n    safety_index = crime_n / (bike_length_mi + 0.1)\n  )\n\n# Summary statistics\nsummary_stats &lt;- school_safety %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    mean_crime = mean(crime_n),\n    mean_bike = mean(as.numeric(bike_length_mi)),\n    high_crime_schools = sum(crime_n &gt;

This suggests that areas with more crime tend to have less biking infrastructure, highlighting potential safety and accessibility concerns for students in those neighborhoods."

Overall Pattern Identification: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses? 2. Equity Assessment: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings? 3. Root Cause Analysis: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk? 4. Strategic Recommendations: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\nExecutive Summary:\nOverall Pattern Identification The multi-level analysis — spanning county-level median income estimates and tract-level demographic breakdowns — reveals systematic data reliability challenges in ACS 5-year estimates County-level: At county scale, median household income estimates show notable variability. Using a 10% MOE cutoff, most counties fell into moderate or low confidence categories, highlighting that uncertainty exists even at higher aggregation levels Tract-level: Reliability issues intensify at the tract scale. Every tract exceeded the 10% MOE threshold for at least one demographic subgroup, 100% of tracts were flagged as high-MOE:(\nEquity Assessment The communities at greatest risk of algorithmic bias are: Smaller or rural tracts: Populations with fewer respondents also face higher sampling error, compounding reliability problems. Black and Hispanic/Latino communities: Their tract-level ACS estimates never meet the 10% reliability threshold. If an allocation algorithm treats these noisy estimates as precise, it will undervalue their needs and direct resources elsewhere.\nRoot Cause Analysis The patterns are rooted in structural features of ACS data collection: Sampling limits: Smaller population groups produce larger standard errors. Differential nonresponse: Minority and immigrant communities may less likely to respond due to barriers and distrust. Survey design constraints: The ACS 5-year estimates aggregate limited samples, and subgroup breakdowns at tract scale exceed the data’s design precision.\nStrategic Recommendations Data use： Flag any tract with MOE% &gt; 10 and avoid treating estimates as precise since sample size is small in tract level. Use fallback geography (county) for variables with extreme MOE.\nStrengthen inputs： Blend multiple indicators (poverty, rent burden, child poverty) to reduce reliance on a single noisy variable. Improve ACS participation via targeted outreach and language support in undercounted communities.\nOutside the data: Introduce human review for flagged tracts before final funding decisions. Pilot and monitor the algorithm annually, recalibrating thresholds as survey data quality evolves. Document and communicate uncertainty explicitly to policymakers and stakeholders."

monitor outcomes\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Recommendations:\nYour Task: Use your analysis results to provide specific guidance to the department.\n\nCounties suitable for immediate algorithmic implementation: Aitkin, Anoka, Becker, Blue Earth, Brown, Carver, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Crow Wing, Dakota, Dodge, Fillmore, Freeborn, Goodhue, Hennepin, Hubbard, Isanti, Itasca, Kanabec, Kandiyohi, Lake, Le Sueur, Lyon, Marshall, Meeker, Mille Lacs, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Pine, Pope, Ramsey, Renville, Rice, Roseau, St. Louis, Scott, Sherburne, Sibley, Stearns, Steele, Wabasha, Wadena, Washington, Wright\n\nCounties listed above have suitable sample size and stronger ACS samples, which means lower MOE. Demographic estimates are robust enough to support algorithm-driven funding without significant reliability concerns. Algorithms here can be implemented immediately with standard fairness monitoring.\n\nCounties requiring additional oversight: Beltrami, Benton, Big Stone, Carlton, Chippewa, Clearwater, Cook, Cottonwood, Douglas, Faribault, Grant, Houston, Jackson, Kittson, Koochiching, Lac qui Parle, Lincoln, McLeod, Mahnomen, Martin, Mower, Murray, Nicollet, Nobles, Norman, Pennington, Pipestone, Polk, Red Lake, Redwood, Rock, Swift, Todd, Waseca, Watonwan, Wilkin, Winona, Yellow Medicine.\n\nRecommended monitoring actions for counties above: Outcome audits: Compare algorithmic allocations against program participation data. Sensitivity testing: Run models with upper/lower confidence bounds (estimate ± MOE) to test robustness. Flagging system: Automatically flag tracts/counties with borderline estimates for human review.\n\nCounties needing alternative approaches:ss Traverse\n\nSuggested alternatives: Manual review: Use staff expertise and local knowledge to adjust allocations. Supplemental data: Incorporate administrative records (school eligibility, Medicaid enrollment, unemployment claims) to cross-validate needs. Community engagement: Consult local service providers or conduct targeted surveys to supplement missing precision."

The KDE surface reinforces this pattern with three major hotspot zones:\n1.Near North / River North area 2.West Side around Humboldt Park and Logan Square 3.South Side corridor extending from Washington Park toward Englewood\nThese locations share certain environmental features commonly associated with elevated burglary risk. In addition, some hotspots overlap areas with documented social and economic disadvantage, vacant housing, and higher levels of physical disorder—factors linked to burglary opportunity structures in environmental criminology."

This makes the analysis cleaner: cell areas are comparable, distance-based features are easier to compute, and we reduce some of the MAUP problems that come from highly uneven, irregular neighborhoods or census tracts.\nThe trade-off is that grid cells are analytically convenient but socially artificial. They do not correspond to real neighborhoods, police beats, or planning districts, so the results are harder to explain to practitioners and often need to be translated back into those official units.\nIn short: grids are better for modelling, official boundaries are better for communication."

This produces a classic zero-inflated and overdispersed distribution, where the variance is much larger than the mean.\nSo many zeros appear because burglary is a spatially clustered event. Most parts of the city experience little or no burglary activity, while a few hotspots absorb most incidents. This distribution is not well-fit by a standard Poisson model, which assumes that the mean and variance are equal. Instead, the overdispersion suggests that models like the Negative Binomial or a zero-inflated count model are more appropriate."

What neighborhoods have better 311 awareness?\nThe 311 system is not a neutral measure of neighborhood conditions. Reporting depends on who knows about 311, who trusts government systems, and who feels empowered to complain. Higher-income and higher-resource neighborhoods tend to have greater 311 awareness, more digital access, and stronger expectations of government responsiveness, which leads to more reporting. In contrast, lower-income communities, immigrant neighborhoods, and historically over-policed areas may underreport due to limited awareness, language barriers, distrust of city services, or simply different norms around what is “worth” reporting."

This visual overlap suggests that physical disorder and burglary risk cluster in similar environments—places with poor maintenance, dumping, or abandoned properties also show elevated burglary activity. This aligns with environmental criminology and “broken windows” dynamics: neighborhoods with more visible disorder may signal lower guardianship and create more opportunities for property crime.\nIn short: the two patterns are not identical, but they cluster in many of the same spaces, indicating a potential relationship worth modeling statistically."

A single sanitation complaint could be random, one-time, or caused by a single resident. But when many nearby cells all show high sanitation complaints, it signals a structural problem in the poor sanitation maintenance.\nLocal Moran’s I identifies exactly these patterns by detecting spatial autocorrelation. High-High clusters indicate areas where a cell with high sanitation complaints is surrounded by other high-value cells. These are true hotspots of disorder, not random noise. Low-High areas reveal local outliers, where a relatively clean cell sits next to a disorder hotspot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLocal Moran’s I identifies:\n\nHigh-High: Hot spots (high values surrounded by high values)\nLow-Low: Cold spots (low values surrounded by low values)\nHigh-Low / Low-High: Spatial outliers\n\nThis helps us understand spatial clustering patterns."

Lower AIC indicates a superior model, so the Negative Binomial clearly provides a better description of the burglary counts.\nThis tells us again that the data exhibits overdispersion: the variance is much larger than the mean, which violates the core assumption of the Poisson model. The Negative Binomial handles this extra variability by adding a dispersion parameter (theta), allowing it to model the heavy-tailed, zero-inflated structure of the burglary data more accurately."

By how much? Is the added complexity worth it?\nThe KDE baseline achieves slightly better predictive accuracy (MAE 2.06 vs. 2.21), but this does not mean the regression model is unnecessary or “not worth it.” The two approaches serve fundamentally different purposes.\nKDE is a purely spatial smoother: it captures clustering extremely well because burglary is highly spatially dependent. Its strength lies in interpolating hotspots, not in explaining why those hotspots exist. In contrast, the regression model provides something KDE cannot: insight into the underlying mechanisms that correlate with burglary patterns. These findings are meaningful because they speak to environmental criminology and “broken windows” dynamics—relationships that KDE, by design, cannot reveal.\nSo while KDE edges out the model in raw predictive accuracy, the regression model is still valuable because it helps us understand the social and spatial processes behind crime, not just map it."

Are there spatial patterns in the errors? What might this reveal?\nThe largest model errors appear in a few concentrated spatial areas, especially in the strong burglary hotspots, and several zones where burglary levels change sharply from one grid cell to the next.\nThe absolute-error map shows that the largest absolute errors are spatially clustered, not randomly scattered. This suggests the model struggles most in places with very high burglary levels, and places with abrupt local variation, where neighboring cells differ strongly.\nThe model’s predictors capture broad trends but cannot fully account for the highly localized, uneven nature of burglary hotspots, which leads to systematic errors in those areas."

The provided scatter plot of Market Value (Predicted) vs. Sale Price (Actual) is an essential diagnostic tool for assessing data quality. - The red line on the plot represents a perfect 1-to-1 relationship (Y=X), where the property’s actual sale price is exactly equal to its predicted market value. While most data points cluster tightly around this line—indicating the “Market Value” is a strong predictor—the plot clearly reveals two distinct types of extreme outliers that do not represent typical market transactions. 1. Removing Non-Market Sales (The Sale Price &lt; 0.05 * Market Value Rule) - There is a dense cluster of points stacked vertically along the y-axis, where Sale Price (X) is near zero, but Market Value (Y) is high (e.g., $1M, $2M, even $4M). These points represent transactions where a property was “sold” for a price that is a tiny fraction of its assessed worth (e.g., a $2,000,000 house sold for $50,000). - These are non-arm’s-length transactions, not true market sales. Examples include sales between family members, inheritance transfers, or other legal transactions where the price does not reflect the market. 2. Removing Anomalous High Sales (The Sale Price &gt; 5 * Market Value Rule) - There are several data points scattered far to the right and bottom of the plot, far below the red Y=X line. These points represent properties where the Sale Price (X) was massively higher than its Market Value (Y). For example, a property with an assessed value of $500,000 (Y) selling for $4,000,000 (X). - These are also not typical sales. They could represent (a) data entry errors, (b) sales where the “Market Value” figure is obsolete (e.g., a run-down property sold for land value/development potential), or (c) properties that underwent major renovations not yet captured in the assessed value. - Retaining these two groups of outliers would severely skew the model’s coefficients and reduce its predictive accuracy for the vast majority of normal, market-based transactions. This filtering rule is a necessary step to clean the data, ensure the model learns from valid transactions, and improve its overall reliability.\n\n1.1.6 enhance the sales data\n\nWe have 8000+ non market transactions, that is 1/4 of the total sales data!

The provided scatter plot of Market Value (Predicted) vs. Sale Price (Actual) is an essential diagnostic tool for assessing data quality. - The red line on the plot represents a perfect 1-to-1 relationship (Y=X), where the property’s actual sale price is exactly equal to its predicted market value. While most data points cluster tightly around this line—indicating the “Market Value” is a strong predictor—the plot clearly reveals two distinct types of extreme outliers that do not represent typical market transactions. 1. Removing Non-Market Sales (The Sale Price &lt; 0.05 * Market Value Rule) - There is a dense cluster of points stacked vertically along the y-axis, where Sale Price (X) is near zero, but Market Value (Y) is high (e.g., $1M, $2M, even $4M). These points represent transactions where a property was “sold” for a price that is a tiny fraction of its assessed worth (e.g., a $2,000,000 house sold for $50,000). - These are non-arm’s-length transactions, not true market sales. Examples include sales between family members, inheritance transfers, or other legal transactions where the price does not reflect the market. 2. Removing Anomalous High Sales (The Sale Price &gt; 5 * Market Value Rule) - There are several data points scattered far to the right and bottom of the plot, far below the red Y=X line. These points represent properties where the Sale Price (X) was massively higher than its Market Value (Y). For example, a property with an assessed value of $500,000 (Y) selling for $4,000,000 (X). - These are also not typical sales. They could represent (a) data entry errors, (b) sales where the “Market Value” figure is obsolete (e.g., a run-down property sold for land value/development potential), or (c) properties that underwent major renovations not yet captured in the assessed value. - Retaining these two groups of outliers would severely skew the model’s coefficients and reduce its predictive accuracy for the vast majority of normal, market-based transactions. This filtering rule is a necessary step to clean the data, ensure the model learns from valid transactions, and improve its overall reliability.\n\n1.1.6 enhance the sales data\n\nWe have 8000+ non market transactions, that is 1/4 of the total sales data!

This means that the majority of houses have lower prices, and very expensive houses are very few in number.\n- Concentration and Outliers: The count of houses in each bin drops rapidly as the price increases. The number of houses above $2,500,000 is very small, indicating the presence of extreme high-price outliers.\n- Preprocessing Requirement: This distribution strongly suggests that before building a house price prediction model, the Sale Price variable will need a transformation, most commonly a log transformation, to make the distribution more closely resemble a normal distribution.\n\n\n3.2 Spatial distribution of sale prices (map)\n\n\nCode\nopa_census_all &lt;- opa_census_all %&gt;%\n  mutate(price_quartile = ntile(sale_price_predicted, 4))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = philly_census, fill = \"lightgrey\", color = \"white\") +\n  geom_sf(data = opa_census_all, aes(color = factor(price_quartile)), size = 0.5, alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d(\n    option = \"plasma\",\n    direction = -1,\n    labels = c(\"0%-25%\", \"25%-50%\", \"50%-75%\", \"75%-100%\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Housing Sales Price in Philadelphia (2023–2024)\",\n    color = \"Sale Price Quartile\"\n  )  +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 3)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings:\n- Spatial Concentration of Housing Prices: Highest Prices are clearly concentrated in the Center City/Downtown area of Philadelphia and its immediate surroundings, which indicates that the most expensive property transactions occur in the high-value areas of and around the city center.\n- Discontinuous Price Transitions: Housing prices do not exhibit smooth gradients across the city; instead, they show abrupt changes between different price quartiles, forming distinct spatial clusters. This suggests that price variations are influenced by fixed boundaries such as neighborhoods, infrastructure, or socio-economic factors, rather than continuous spatial diffusion. - Peripheral Price Patterns: Lower-price quartiles (0%-25% and 25%-50%) are predominantly located in the outer regions of the city, particularly in the northern and southern peripheries, indicating a clear core-periphery divide in housing values.\n\n\n3.3 Price vs. structural features (scatter plots)\n\n\nCode\nopa_census_plot &lt;- opa_census_all %&gt;%\n  mutate(log_sale_price = log(sale_price_predicted))\n\n# 1️⃣ total_livable_area\np1 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = log(total_livable_area), y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Log(Livable Area)\",\n    x = \"Log(Total Livable Area)\",\n    y = \"Log(Sale Price)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\n# 2️⃣ number_of_bathrooms\np2 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = number_of_bathrooms, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Bathrooms\",\n    x = \"Number of Bathrooms\",  \n    y = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\n# 3️⃣ interior_condition\np3 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = interior_condition, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\", width = 0.2, height = 0) +  \n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Interior Condition\",\n    x = \"Interior Condition\",\n    y = \"Log(Sale Price)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\n# 4️⃣ house_age\np4 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = house_age^2, y = log_sale_price)) + \n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. House Age²\",\n    x = \"House Age² (2025 - Year Built)²\",\n    y = \"\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\n(p1 + p2) / (p3 + p4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquarto check Key Findings:\n- Strong Positive Correlation with Size and Bathrooms: There is a clear positive linear relationship between the log of sale price and both the log of total livable area and the number of bathrooms. This indicates that larger properties and those with more bathrooms command significantly higher market prices. - Non-Linear Relationship with Interior Condition: While a general positive trend exists, the relationship between log sale price and interior condition rating is not perfectly linear. The data dispersion suggests that the effect of interior condition on price may be subject to diminishing marginal returns or other non-linear dynamics. - Negative Correlation with House Age Squared: A significant negative relationship is observed between log sale price and the squared term of house age. This indicates that property values depreciate as homes get older, and this depreciation effect may accelerate over time, reflecting a non-linear aging effect on housing value.\n\n\n3.4 Price vs. spatial & Social features (scatter plots)\n\n\nCode\nopa_census_plot &lt;- opa_census_all %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    log_sale_price = log(sale_price_predicted),\n    sqrt_crime_count = sqrt(crime_count)\n  )\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = ba_rate, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. BA Rate\",\n       x = \"Bachelor's Degree Rate\", y = \"Log(Sale Price)\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = unemployment_rate, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Unemployment Rate\",\n       x = \"Unemployment Rate\", y = \"\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\np3 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = median_income, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = dollar_format()) +\n  labs(title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Median Income\",\n       x = \"Median Household Income (USD)\", y = \"Log(Sale Price)\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\np4 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = avg_past_price_density, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Past Price Density\",\n       x = \"Average Past Price Density\", y = \"\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\np5 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = sqrt_crime_count, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. √(Crime Count)\",\n       x = \"Square Root of Crime Count\", y = \"Log(Sale Price)\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\np6 &lt;- ggplot(opa_census_plot, aes(x = transit_count, y = log_sale_price)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"#6A1B9A\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Log(Sale Price) vs. Transit Count\",\n       x = \"Number of Transit Stops Nearby\", y = \"\") +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 10)\n\n(p1 | p2 | p3) / (p4 | p5 | p6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings:\n- Strong Socioeconomic Influence: Housing prices show clear positive correlations with key socioeconomic indicators. Both bachelor’s degree rate and median household income exhibit strong positive relationships with sale prices, indicating that neighborhoods with higher educational attainment and income levels command substantially higher property values. - Negative Impact of Crime and Unemployment: There are evident negative relationships between housing prices and both crime levels (measured by square root of crime count) and unemployment rates. This demonstrates that public safety and local economic vitality are significant determinants of property values in Philadelphia. - Positive Effects of Historical Prices and Transit Access: Sale prices maintain a positive relationship with both historical price density and accessibility to public transportation. This suggests that areas with established high-value characteristics and better transit infrastructure maintain their premium in the housing market, reflecting path dependence in neighborhood valuation and the value of transportation accessibility.\n\n\nOther visualization\n\n\nCode\ntract_price &lt;- opa_census_all %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  group_by(GEOID) %&gt;%\n  summarise(avg_past_price_density = mean(avg_past_price_density, na.rm = TRUE))\n\ntract_map &lt;- philly_census %&gt;%\n  left_join(tract_price, by = \"GEOID\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = tract_map, aes(fill = avg_past_price_density), color = \"white\", size = 0.2) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(\n    low = \"white\", high = \"#6A1B9A\",\n    name = \"Mean Sale Price Per sqft\",\n    labels = scales::dollar_format(),\n    na.value = \"grey60\"\n  ) +\n  scale_alpha(range = c(0.2, 0.8), name = \"Interior Condition\") +\n  \n  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Buffered Area Mean Sold Price of 2022\",\n    subtitle = \"clustered in census tracts\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntract_condition &lt;- opa_census_all %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  group_by(GEOID) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_interior_condition = mean(interior_condition, na.rm = TRUE))\n\ntract_map &lt;- philly_census %&gt;%\n  left_join(tract_condition, by = \"GEOID\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = tract_map, aes(fill = mean_interior_condition), color = \"white\", size = 0.2) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(\n    low = \"#6A1B9A\", high = \"white\",      # 浅橙→深红，更直观表现高低\n    name = \"Avg Interior Condition\",\n    na.value = \"grey60\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Interior Condition by Census Tract\",\n    subtitle = \"Darker color = better average condition\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntract_area &lt;- opa_census_all %&gt;%\n  st_drop_geometry() %&gt;%\n  group_by(GEOID) %&gt;%\n  summarise(mean_total_livable_area = mean(total_livable_area, na.rm = TRUE))\n\ntract_map &lt;- philly_census %&gt;%\n  left_join(tract_area, by = \"GEOID\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = tract_map, aes(fill = mean_total_livable_area), color = \"white\", size = 0.2) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(\n    low = \"white\", high = \"#6A1B9A\",   \n    name = \"Avg Livable Area (sqft)\",\n    labels = scales::comma_format(),\n    na.value = \"grey60\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Livable Area by Census Tract\",\n    subtitle = \"Darker color indicates larger average livable area\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Findings:\n- Spatial Variation in Property Values: The average sale price per square foot shows significant geographic clustering across census tracts, with distinct high-value areas concentrated in specific neighborhoods. This indicates strong spatial autocorrelation in housing prices, where adjacent tracts tend to have similar price levels. - Correlation Between Property Condition and Location: Better average interior conditions are systematically concentrated in particular geographic areas, suggesting that housing maintenance and quality are not randomly distributed but follow spatial patterns that may correlate with neighborhood characteristics and property values. - Heterogeneous Distribution of Housing Size: The average livable area varies substantially across census tracts, with larger properties clustered in specific regions. This spatial patterning of housing size complements the price distribution, indicating that both property characteristics and location factors contribute to the overall housing market structure in Philadelphia."

Combined with the insignificant linear term, this suggests a slight U-shaped relationship, where new homes and very old homes (perhaps with historical value) command a premium over middle-aged homes. - interior_condition (-0.114): Assuming a higher value means worse condition, each one-unit worsening in condition is associated with an 11.4% decrease in price. - quality_grade_num (0.070): Each one-unit increase in the quality grade is associated with a 7.0% increase in price. - fireplaces (0.117): Each additional fireplace is associated with a 11.7% increase in price. - garage_spaces (0.143): Each additional garage space is associated with a 14.3% increase in price. - central_air_dummy (0.458): Homes with central air are estimated to be 45.8% more expensive than the baseline (e.g., no AC). This is a very significant amenity premium. - central_air_missing (-0.230): Homes where central air data is missing are 23.0% cheaper than the baseline.\n4.2 Census variables:\n\n\nCode\nmodel_2 &lt;- lm(log(sale_price_predicted) ~ \n                  log(total_livable_area)  +   #Structural\n                  number_of_bathrooms + \n                  house_age_c +\n                  house_age_c2 +\n                  interior_condition +\n                  quality_grade_num + \n                  fireplaces +\n                  garage_spaces +\n                  central_air_dummy + \n                  central_air_missing+\n                \n                  income_scaled +              #Census\n                  ba_rate +\n                  unemployment_rate,\n  \n              data = opa_census_all,\n              weight=weight_mix\n               )\nsummary(model_2)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = log(sale_price_predicted) ~ log(total_livable_area) + \n    number_of_bathrooms + house_age_c + house_age_c2 + interior_condition + \n    quality_grade_num + fireplaces + garage_spaces + central_air_dummy + \n    central_air_missing + income_scaled + ba_rate + unemployment_rate, \n    data = opa_census_all, weights = weight_mix)\n\nWeighted Residuals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3.2514 -0.1415  0.0546  0.2237  2.0880 \n\nCoefficients:\n                            Estimate   Std.

This suggests Model 1 overestimated the impact of area. Why? Because larger homes are often located in wealthier neighborhoods. Model 1 incorrectly attributed some of the “wealthy neighborhood” premium to “large area.” - quality_grade_num (0.0015 vs 0.070): The coefficient for quality grade became statistically insignificant (p=0.520). This is a key finding: home quality is highly correlated with neighborhood income. Once we directly control for income (income_scaled), the independent effect of quality grade disappears. - central_air_dummy (0.219 vs 0.458): The premium for central air was halved. This also indicates that central air is more common in affluent areas, and Model 1 suffered from significant Omitted Variable Bias (OVB). - New Variable (Census) Interpretation: - income_scaled (0.455): A one-unit increase in standardized census tract income is associated with a 45.5% increase in price. A very strong positive effect. - ba_rate (0.0129): A 1 percentage point increase in the neighborhood’s bachelor’s degree attainment rate is associated with a 1.3% price increase. - unemployment_rate (-0.0066): A 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a 0.66% decrease in price.\n4.3 Spatial features:\n\n\nCode\nmodel_3 &lt;- lm(log(sale_price_predicted) ~ \n                  log(total_livable_area)  +   #Structural\n                  number_of_bathrooms + \n                  house_age_c +\n                  house_age_c2 +\n                  interior_condition +\n                  quality_grade_num + \n                  fireplaces +\n                  garage_spaces +\n                  central_air_dummy + \n                  central_air_missing+\n                \n                  income_scaled +              #Census \n                  ba_rate +\n                  unemployment_rate +\n                \n                  transit_count+\n                  avg_past_price_density+      #Spatial \n                  sqrt(crime_count) +\n                  log(nearest_hospital_knn3),\n              \n              data = opa_census_all,\n              weight=weight_mix\n               )\nsummary(model_3)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = log(sale_price_predicted) ~ log(total_livable_area) + \n    number_of_bathrooms + house_age_c + house_age_c2 + interior_condition + \n    quality_grade_num + fireplaces + garage_spaces + central_air_dummy + \n    central_air_missing + income_scaled + ba_rate + unemployment_rate + \n    transit_count + avg_past_price_density + sqrt(crime_count) + \n    log(nearest_hospital_knn3), data = opa_census_all, weights = weight_mix)\n\nWeighted Residuals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-3.03217 -0.09905  0.05666  0.18464  2.17114 \n\nCoefficients:\n                               Estimate   Std.

This again reveals OVB in Model 2. The large “income” effect in Model 2 was confounded with “spatial amenities”—high-income individuals tend to live in low-crime, accessible areas. - ba_rate (0.0027 vs 0.0129): The education premium also dropped significantly for the same reason. - garage_spaces (0.095 vs 0.170): The garage premium decreased, likely because spatial variables (like density or transit access) have captured related information. - New Variable (Spatial) Interpretation: - transit_count (0.00029): Each additional nearby public transit stop is associated with a 0.029% increase in price. - avg_past_price_density (0.0032): As a proxy for local market heat or locational value, each unit increase is associated with a 0.32% price increase. - sqrt(crime_count) (-0.040): A one-unit increase in the square root of the crime count is associated with a 4.0% decrease in price. - log(nearest_hospital_knn3) (0.087): A 1% increase in the distance from the nearest hospital is associated with a 0.087% increase in price. This suggests people prefer to live further away from hospitals (perhaps to avoid noise, traffic, or sirens), not closer.\n4.4 Interactions and fixed effects:\n\n\nCode\nmodel_4 &lt;- lm(log(sale_price_predicted) ~ \n                  log(total_livable_area)  +   #Structural\n                  number_of_bathrooms + \n                  house_age_c +\n                  house_age_c2 +\n                  interior_condition +\n                  quality_grade_num + \n                  fireplaces +\n                  garage_spaces +\n                  central_air_dummy + \n                  central_air_missing+\n                \n                  income_scaled +              #Census \n                  ba_rate +\n                  unemployment_rate +\n                \n                  transit_count+\n                  avg_past_price_density+      #Spatial \n                  sqrt(crime_count) +\n                  log(nearest_hospital_knn3)+\n                \n                  (interior_condition * income_scaled)+  #FE & Interaction\n                  factor(zip_code),\n              \n              data = opa_census_all,\n              weight=weight_mix\n               )\nsummary(model_4)\n\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = log(sale_price_predicted) ~ log(total_livable_area) + \n    number_of_bathrooms + house_age_c + house_age_c2 + interior_condition + \n    quality_grade_num + fireplaces + garage_spaces + central_air_dummy + \n    central_air_missing + income_scaled + ba_rate + unemployment_rate + \n    transit_count + avg_past_price_density + sqrt(crime_count) + \n    log(nearest_hospital_knn3) + (interior_condition * income_scaled) + \n    factor(zip_code), data = opa_census_all, weights = weight_mix)\n\nWeighted Residuals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-2.86007 -0.09067  0.05500  0.16974  2.17553 \n\nCoefficients:\n                                     Estimate   Std.

It shows that the impact of interior_condition depends on income_scaled. - The total marginal effect of interior_condition is:\\[= -0.1695 + 0.1165 \\times \\text{income\\_scaled}\\] - At the baseline income level (income_scaled = 0), each one-unit worsening in condition is associated with a 17.0% price decrease (-0.1695). However, this penalty is mitigated (lessened) in higher-income areas. For each one-unit increase in income_scaled, the negative penalty of poor condition is reduced by 11.7 percentage points. This may imply that in high-income neighborhoods, “fixer-uppers” (homes in poor condition) are seen as investment opportunities with high renovation potential. Therefore, the market penalty for “poor condition” is smaller."

    "text": "Phase 7: Conclusions & Recommendations\n\nConclusion:\n\nOur final model’s R² is 0.84, indicating that the model explains 84% of the variance in log sale prices. The RMSE is , showing that the model’s predictions are reasonably close to the observed values.\n\nLivable Area of the House matters most for Philadelphia prices.\n\n\n\nRecommendations:\n\nEquity concerns\n\nWhich neighborhoods are hardest to predict?\n\nThe largest prediction errors occur primarily in central Philadelphia, where both overestimation and underestimation coexist within close proximity. This pattern indicates that the model struggles most in areas with high housing heterogeneity- neighborhoods that contain a mix of old row houses, newly renovated apartments, and varying property types within short distances.\nIn contrast, outer neighborhoods such as those in the northwest and northeast tend to have more consistent housing characteristics, leading to smaller residuals. The central tracts’ larger residuals suggest that cultural or historical features have introduced variability that the model’s current features (mainly physical characteristics) cannot fully explain.\n\nAny data bias?\n\nThe observed spatial pattern of prediction errors reflects inherent data bias. The dataset likely overrepresents mid-range housing conditions and underrepresents both luxury and low-income housing. As shown in the livable area and interior condition maps, data coverage in wealthier areas (especially the northwest) is limited, and these tracts often contain more unique, high-value properties that the model cannot generalize well.\n\nWealthier tracts are more likely to be well-documented, while poorer areas lack records, creating spatial imbalance in model performance.\n\nHigh-priced homes typically have larger negotiation margins, meaning their final sale prices are often lower than the listed prices. In contrast, low-priced homes sell closer to their listing prices. As a result, model tends to overestimate expensive homes and underestimate affordable ones, introducing systematic bias.\n\n\nRecommendations to government\n\n\nImmediate System Calibration: We recommend utilizing our model’s findings to immediately adjust property assessments in systematically overvalued low-income communities. This action will ensure a fair distribution of the tax burden and address current inequities.\nIntegrate Advanced Spatial Features: We advise the Office of Property Assessment (OPA) to permanently integrate the effective spatial characteristics identified by our study—specifically Comparable Sales Proxies (surrounding transaction prices) and Neighborhood Fixed Effects—into the next-generation AVM. This will significantly enhance the model’s responsiveness to rapidly changing market dynamics.\nExtreme high values almost exclusively stem from corporate transactions and require manual review for outliers.\n\n\nLimitations and nest steps\n\nLimitations: Inherent Data Biases\n\nOur predictive accuracy is constrained by inherent data biases which affect equity. We find a dual challenge in data coverage: in affluent areas, high-value, unique properties suffer from data sparsity, making generalization difficult. Conversely, lower-income areas often show data incompleteness, leading to less reliable predictions and higher residual errors. Critically, we observed a price-tier bias: high-priced homes tend to sell below their list price, while low-priced homes transact closer to it. This systemic pattern means the model is prone to over-assessing expensive properties and under-assessing affordable ones, creating a structural risk for vertical inequity in the tax system.\n\nNext Steps: Enhancing Data Quality and Fairness\n\nTo address these limitations, our next steps focus on data enrichment and equitable optimization. The City should partner with us to integrate non-public data, such as detailed appraisal records and permit data, which can account for unobserved renovation quality and close the data gap. Furthermore, to combat the systematic price-tier bias, we recommend integrating fairness metrics directly into the AVM’s optimization process. This will shift the model’s objective beyond simple average accuracy (RMSE) to ensure that prediction errors are uniformly low across all price tiers and all Philadelphia neighborhoods, securing both accuracy and equity."

    "text": "THE PROBLEM: REACTIVE POLICING\n\nSEPTA carries thousands of passengers daily. Yet for Transit Police, a core question remains unresolved:\n\nDoes high ridership actually create safety (“Eyes on the Street”) — or does it increase opportunities for crime (“Potential Targets”)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🚫 CURRENT ISSUES\n\n\nInefficiency: Patrols often follow intuition instead of evidence.\nSafety Gaps: High-risk stops get overlooked because they aren’t high-ridership.\nResource Strain: The “shotgun approach” spreads limited personnel too thin.\n\n\n\n\n\n🚨 Our Policy Goal\n\n\nHelp SEPTA Transit Police move from reactive responses toward evidence-guided deployment.\nUse ridership–crime modeling to identify “High-Risk Anomalies” — stops where crime risk is unexpectedly high relative to passenger volume and context."
